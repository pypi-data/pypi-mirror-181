Description: wai.annotations core module, containing core data structures and basic data loading and preprocessing techniques.
        
        The following sources are available:
        
        * `from-audio-files-ac`: dummy reader that turns audio files into a classification dataset.
        * `from-audio-files-sp`: dummy reader that turns audio files into a speech dataset.
        * `from-images-ic`: dummy reader that turns images into an image classification dataset.
        * `from-images-is`: dummy reader that turns images into an image segmentation dataset.
        * `from-images-od`: dummy reader that turns images into an object detection dataset.
        
        
        The following inline stream processors (ISPs) area available:
        
        * `check-duplicate-filenames`: causes the conversion stream to halt when multiple dataset items have the same filename
        * `clean-transcript`: ISP that cleans speech transcripts.
        * `coerce-box`: converts all annotation bounds into box regions
        * `coerce-mask`: converts all annotation bounds into polygon regions
        * `convert-image-format`: converts images from one format to another
        * `dimension-discarder`: removes annotations which fall outside certain size constraints
        * `discard-invalid-images`: discards images that cannot be loaded (e.g., corrupt image file or annotations with no image)
        * `discard-negatives`: discards negative examples (those without annotations) from the stream
        * `filter-labels`: filters detected objects down to those with specified labels.
        * `filter-metadata`: filters detected objects based on their meta-data.
        * `label-present`: keeps or discards images depending on whether annotations with certain label(s) are present. Checks can be further tightened by defining regions in the image that annotations must overlap with (or not overlap at all).
        * `map-labels`: maps object-detection labels from one set to another
        * `passthrough`: dummy ISP which has no effect on the conversion stream
        * `polygon-discarder`: removes annotations with polygons which fall outside certain point limit constraints
        * `remove-classes`: removes classes from classification/image-segmentation instances
        * `rename`: ISP that renames files.
        * `sample`: ISP that selects a subset from the stream.
        * `strip-annotations`: ISP which removes annotations from instances
        
        
        The following cross-domain converters (XDCs) are available:
        * `od-to-ic`: converts image object-detection instances into image classification instances
        * `od-to-is`: converts image object-detection instances into image segmentation instances
        
        
        The following sinks are available:
        
        * `to-audio-files-ac`: dummy writer that just outputs audio files from classification datasets.
        * `to-audio-fileS-sp`: dummy writer that just outputs audio files from speech datasets.
        * `to-images-ic`: dummy writer that just outputs images from image classification datasets.
        * `to-images-is`: dummy writer that just outputs images from image segmentation datasets.
        * `to-images-od`: dummy writer that just outputs images from object detection datasets.
        * `to-void-ac`: consumes audio classification instances without writing them.
        * `to-void-ic`: consumes image classification instances without writing them.
        * `to-void-is`: consumes image segmentation instances without writing them.
        * `to-void-od`: consumes instances without writing them.
        * `to-void-sp`: consumes instances without writing them.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.2.2 (2022-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Updated wai.common requirement to v0.0.41.
        - Added spectrum classification domain.
        - Bug/typo fixes.
        
        0.2.1 (2022-10-20)
        ------------------
        
        - Added WriteLabels ISP which can read labels from classification, object-detection
          and image-segmentation streams, and writes them to disk.
        
        0.2.0 (2022-09-06)
        ------------------
        
        - FilterLabels ISP now treats elements as negative ones if no labels left after
          filtering (in order to use `discard-negatives` in pipeline); also works on
          image classification domain now as well
        - FilterLabels ISP can filter out located objects that don't fall within a certain
          region (x,y,w,h - normalized or absolute) using a supplied IoU threshold; useful
          when concentrating on annotations in the center of an image, e.g., for images
          generated with the subimages ISP (object detection domain only)
        - `logging._LoggingEnabled` module now sets the *numba* logging level to `WARNING`
        - `logging._LoggingEnabled` module now sets the *shapely* logging level to `WARNING`
        - `core.domain.Data` class now stores the path of the file as well
        - Rename ISP allows renaming of files, e.g., for disambiguating across batches
        - `batch_split.Splitter` now handles cases when the regexp does not produce any matches
          (and outputs a warning when in verbose mode)
        - Added LabelPresent ISP, which skips object detection images that do not have specified
          labels (or if annotations do not overlap with defined regions; can be inverted).
        - Using wai.common==0.0.40 now to avoid parse error output when accessing `poly_x`/`poly_y`
          meta-data in `LocatedObject` instances when containing empty strings.
        - The CleanTranscript ISP can be used to clean up speech transcripts.
        - Bug fix for splitting where split-scheduling was calculated with swapped iteration order,
          leading to runs of splits rather than desired interleaving. Added --no-interleave flag to
          re-enable bug for backwards compatibility.
        
        
        0.1.8 (2022-06-21)
        ------------------
        
        - Added new audio domain for classification using suffix `-ac`
        - Added dataset reader for audio files: `from-audio-files-sp`, `from-audio-files-ac`
        - Added dataset writer for audio files: `to-audio-files-sp`, `to-audio-files-ac`

        0.1.7 (2022-06-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Added `discard-invalid-images` ISP for removing corrupt images or annotations with no image attached.
        - Added `batch-split` sub-command for splitting individual batches of annotations into subsets like train/test/val.
          Supports grouping of files within batches (eg multiple images of the same object).
        - Added `filter-metadata` ISP for filtering object detection.
        - Restricted maximum characters per line in help output to 100 to avoid long help strings to become unreadable.
        - The `polygon-discarder` now annotations that either have no polygon or invalid polygons.
        - Added descriptions to the help screens of the main commands.
        - The `ImageSegmentationAnnotation` class now outputs the unique values in its exception when there are
          more unique values than labels
        - The `Data` class (module: `wai.annotations.core.domain`) now outputs a warning message if a file cannot
          be read; also added `LoggingEnabled` mixin.

          label (as a dictionary); moved from the ToLayerSegments conversion (wai.annotations.layersegments)
        
        
        0.1.5 (2022-05-09)
        ------------------
        
        - Added dataset readers that generate dummy datasets from images: `from-images-ic`, `from-images-is`, `from-images-od`
        - Added dataset writers that just output the images from datasets: `to-images-ic`, `to-images-is`, `to-images-od`
        
        0.1.4 (2021-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ISP for discarding polygons that either have too few or too many points (`polygon-discarder`)
        - Added `--verbose` flag to `dimension-discarder` ISP for outputting information when an annotation
          gets discarded.
        
        0.1.3 (2021-06-22)
        -------------------
        
        - Added cross-domain converter which reduces object-detection datasets to image classification
          by looking for single/majority objects/labels.
        
        0.1.2 (2021-06-01)
        -------------------
