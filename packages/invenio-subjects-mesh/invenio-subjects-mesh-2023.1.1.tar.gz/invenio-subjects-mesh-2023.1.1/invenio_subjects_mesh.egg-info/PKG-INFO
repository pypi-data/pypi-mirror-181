        MeSH subject terms for InvenioRDM
        
        Install this extension to get Medical Subject Headings topics into your instance.
        
        ## Installation
        
        From your instance directory:
        
            pipenv install invenio-subjects-mesh
        
        This will add it to your Pipfile.
        
        ### Versions
        
        This repository follows [calendar versioning](https://calver.org/):
        
        `2021.06.18` is both a valid semantic version and an indicator of the year-month corresponding to the loaded MeSH terms.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are 2 types of users for this package. Maintainers of the package and instance administrators.
        
        ### Instance administrators
        
        For instance administrators, after you have installed the extension as per the steps above, you will want to reload your instance's fixtures: `pipenv run invenio rdm-records fixtures` . Updating existing terms currently requires manual replacement.
        
        ### Maintainers
        
        When a new list of MeSH term comes out, this package should be updated. Here we show how.
        
        0- Make sure you have cloned this package and installed it locally with the `all` extra:
        
            pipenv run pip install -e .[all]
        
        1- Update:
        
            pipenv run invenio-subjects-mesh
        
           This will
        
           1- Download the new list (TODO - For now download it manually and place it in `invenio_subjects_mesh/download/data/`)
           2- Read it filtering for topics
           3- Convert terms to InvenioRDM subjects format
           4- Write those to `invenio_subjects_mesh/vocabularies/subjects_mesh.jsonl` file
        
        2- When you are happy with the list, bump the version in `invenio_subjects_mesh/__init__.py` and release it.
        
        **Note**
        
        There are some amenities in the code to filter/interact with MeSH terms a little if one is so inclined.
        
        
        ## Future Ideas
        
        - InvenioRDM doesn't have a way to update pre-existing subjects yet. Once there is one,
          this package should provide the functionality to update MeSH terms.
