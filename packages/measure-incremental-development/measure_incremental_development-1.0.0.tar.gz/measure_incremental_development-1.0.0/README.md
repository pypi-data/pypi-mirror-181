# Measure of Incremental Development
The Measure of Incremental Development (MID) is a metric that evaluates a student's 
adherence to incremental development given snapshots of the student's code at compilation. Currently, it has been 
developed and trained on student data from a Python-based, introductory computer science course.

## Usage

First, install the Python package in the appropriate directory with `pip` using:  
`pip install measure_incremental_development`

Second, import the `calculateMID` function in the Python file you would like to perform the calculation:  
`from measure_incremental_development.compute import calculate_mid`

Third, make the appropriate call to the `calculate_mid` function (make sure the input data is formatted correctly):  
`mid_statistic = calculate_mid(snapshots)`

Note: the input data `snapshots` should be formatted as described below

## Input Data Format

The `calculate_mid` function will take as input a *list of strings*, where each element is a string that is the exact text of the student code (including whitespace).

An example of an appropriate input:  

```python
from measure_incremental_development.compute import calculate_mid

snap1 = """def hello(name):
    print(name)"""

snap2 = """def hello(name):
    welcome_string = "Hello " + name"""

snap3 = """def hello(name):
    welcome_string = "Hello " + name
    return welcome_string"""

snapshots = [snap1, snap2, snap3]

mid_statistic = calculate_mid(snapshots)
```
