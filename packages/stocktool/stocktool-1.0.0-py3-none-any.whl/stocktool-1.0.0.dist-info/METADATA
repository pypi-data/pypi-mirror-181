# StockPrice 
A Tool for visualize and forecast the stock price, and give user investment strategy.

## Overview

One investor might want to predict the trend for a specific stock, and to know which stock is better to invest in based on the past stock price. As stock market changed so rapidly, it might be hard to make the right investment strategy by analyzing the data manually. Thus, we built a tool for users to visualize, analyze and forecast stocks

## Requirements

StockPrice requires a Python environment higher than Python 3.0.

## Installation

	`pip install stockprice`

	If this does not work, run the follow command first

	`pip install datetime pandas_datareader plotly sktime tbats requests_cache pandas_market_calendars`

- Method 2: Install from the GitHub repo

	`pip install git+https://github.com/Ko2259/StockPrice.git`

- Method 3: Clone this repository and set up a virtual environment(suggested method due to the dependencies)

	2. Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:Ko2259/StockPrice.git`
	3. Change the directory to StockPrice using `cd StockPrice`
	4. Set up a new virtual environment using `condo env create -f environment.yml`
	5. Activate the virtual environment using `condo activate stockprice`
	6. After finish analyzing, deactivate the virtual environment using `condo deactivate`
