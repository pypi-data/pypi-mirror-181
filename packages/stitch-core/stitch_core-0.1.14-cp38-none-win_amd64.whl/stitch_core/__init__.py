    The following keys will be in the returned dictionary:
     - `anonymous_to_named`: This is a mapping from anonymous abstractions to named abstractions, for example from "#(lambda (+ $0 2))" to "fn_2", since
       DreamCoder operates over anonymous abstractions while Stitch operates over named ones. Since there isn't a canonical ordering to the anonymous
       abstractions in a dreamcoder-style json, this function will sort them by length and use that as the ordering, since this has the property that
       abstractions used within larger abstractions will be named first.
     - `programs`: These are the programs translated from anonymous format to named format
     - `tasks`: These are the tasks associated with each program, since DreamCoder has a concept of tasks. See also :ref:`compression_objectives`.
     - `rewritten_dreamcoder=True`: This is a flag that tells compress() to return the dreamcoder-formatted programs in the `.json["rewritten_dreamcoder]` fied of its output.
