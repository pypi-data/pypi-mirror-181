    Solves the problem of string methods to uppercase/lowercase of 'i, I' characters in Turkish; for upper, lower, capitalize, title methods
    For example strings are converted as: "Islak".lower() -> "ıslak" but in Turkish language it should be converted as "ıslak", this class solves this problem.

    Usage: trStr("IRAK'TA OLAY VAR").lower() -> "ırak'ta olay var"
