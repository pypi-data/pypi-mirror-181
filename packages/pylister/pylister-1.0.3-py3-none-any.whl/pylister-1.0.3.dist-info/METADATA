# Pylister

Pylister is a tool that you can use to manage your projects through the terminal.\
It is pretty simple to use. You add projects to Pylister (no directories needed, only a name is enough), you can also add descriptions to these projects, and the main objective of Pylister is to store and manage the tasks that you create for these projects.

## Installation

*Note: Python is required for installation*
```
pip install pylister
```

## Usage

Notes:
- You can use either `pylister` or `pyl`
- \<Option> is required, [Option] is optional
- For options that need more than one word, use quotation marks:\
    `--desc This is a description` (Wrong)\
    `--desc "This is a description"` (Right)
