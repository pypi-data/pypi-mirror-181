Example for sharing email records between two domains managed at cloudflare:

```yaml
providers:
  zones:
    class: octodns_namedfileyaml.YamlProvider
    directory: ./zones
    enforce_order: False
    default_ttl: 300
  shared.email:
    class: octodns_namedfileyaml.NamedFileYamlProvider
    directory: ./shared
    filename: mail.yaml
  cloudflare:
    class: octodns_cloudflare.CloudflareProvider
    token: env/CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN
    strict_supports: true

zones:
  example.com.:
    sources:
      - zones
      - shared.email
    targets:
      - cloudflare
  example.net.:
    sources:
      - zones
      - shared.email
    targets:
      - cloudflare
```

### Support Information

#### Records

All octoDNS record types are supported.

#### Dynamic

NamedFileYamlProvider does not support dynamic records.

### Development

See the [/script/](/script/) directory for some tools to help with the development process. They generally follow the [Script to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all) pattern. Most useful is `./script/bootstrap` which will create a venv and install both the runtime and development related requirements. It will also hook up a pre-commit hook that covers most of what's run by CI.
