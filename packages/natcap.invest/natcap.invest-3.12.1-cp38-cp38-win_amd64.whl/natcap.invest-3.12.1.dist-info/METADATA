InVEST: Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs
================================================================

About  InVEST
=============

InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.

Older versions of InVEST ran as script tools in the ArcGIS ArcToolBox environment,
but have almost all been ported over to a purely open-source python environment.

InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.

Installing InVEST
=================

Python Dependencies
-------------------

Dependencies for ``natcap.invest`` are listed in ``requirements.txt``.
Additionally, a python binding for Qt is needed to use the InVEST GUI, but is
not required for development against ``natcap.invest``.  InVEST uses the
interface library ``qtpy`` to support ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2``.  In our 
experience, ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2`` have been easiest to work with.  One of
these bindings for Qt must be installed in order to use the GUI.


Installing from Source
----------------------

If you have a compiler installed and configured for your system, and
dependencies installed, the easiest way to install InVEST as a python package
is:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install natcap.invest


Installing the latest development version
-----------------------------------------

The latest development version of InVEST can be installed from our git
source tree:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/natcap/invest@master#egg=natcap.invest

Development
===========

Dependencies for developing InVEST are listed in ``requirements.txt`` and in
``requirements-dev.txt``.  If you're running a GUI, you'll need a Qt binding
(see above) and the packages installed in ``requirements-gui.txt``.
