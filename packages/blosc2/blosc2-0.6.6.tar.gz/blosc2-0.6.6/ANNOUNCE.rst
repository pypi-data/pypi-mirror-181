Announcing Python-Blosc2 0.6.6
==============================

This is a maintenance release that provides arm64 wheels for Mac (this time for real).

Remember that in the 0.6 we introduced support for pre- and post-filters.
For more info about the prefilter and postfilter machinery, see slides in:
https://www.blosc.org/docs/Blosc2-Debunking-Myths.pdf

See also some notebooks exercising these exciting new features:

Changes from python-blosc to python-blosc2
------------------------------------------

* The functions `compress_ptr` and `decompress_ptr` are replaced by pack and unpack since Pickle
  protocol 5 comes with out-of-band data.
* The function `pack_array` is equivalent to `pack`, which accepts any object with attributes `itemsize`
  and `size`.
* On the other hand, the function `unpack` doesn't return a numpy array whereas the `unpack_array`
  builds that array.
* The `blosc.NOSHUFFLE` is replaced by the `blosc2.NOFILTER`, but for backward
  compatibility `blosc2.NOSHUFFLE` still exists.
* A bytearray or NumPy object can be passed to the `blosc2.decompress` function to store the
  decompressed data.


## What is it?

Blosc is an open source high performance compressor optimized for binary data
(i.e. floating point numbers, integers and booleans). It has
been designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster
than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach
via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc main goal is not just to reduce the
size of large datasets
on-disk or in-memory, but also to accelerate memory-bound computations.

python-blosc2 is a pythonic wrapper for the C-Blosc2 library.
