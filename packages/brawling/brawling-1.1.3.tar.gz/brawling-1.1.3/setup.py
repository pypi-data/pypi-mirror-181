    'long_description': '# Brawling\n\nSync + async wrapper for the Brawl Stars API\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install normally (only sync)\n\n```\npip install brawling\n```\n\nThere are three additional extras you can install: async, cache, acache\n\nTo install with caching support (only sync, installs requests-cache)\n\n```\npip install brawling[cache]\n```\n\nTo install with async support (will install aiohttp)\n\n```\npip install brawling[async]\n```\n\nTo install with async caching support (will also install aiohttp, aiohttp-client-cache and aiosqlite)\n\n```\npip install brawling[acache]\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nUsage is very simple and straightforward:\n\n```py\nimport brawling\n\n# This can be either the API token,\n# or the path to the file with it.\nTOKEN = "..."\n\n# Initialize the client\n\nclient = brawling.Client(TOKEN)\nbattle_log = client.get_battle_log("#yourtag")\nclient.close()\n\n# or, in an async function\n\nclient = brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN)\nbattle_log = await client.get_battle_log("#yourtag")\nawait client.aclose() # note the \'aclose\'\n\n# Prints "Battle(battle_time=...)"\nprint(battle_log[0])\n```\n\nSince 1.1 there are also context managers, to automatically release resources:\n\n```py\nwith brawling.Client(TOKEN) as client:\n    player = client.get_player("#...")\n\n# or, in an async function\n\nasync with brawling.AsyncClient(TOKEN) as client:\n    player = await client.get_player("#...")\n```\n\nFor some endpoints, there\'s also a possibility to page over them:\n\n```py\n# Returns a generator which fetches up to 20 total pages\n# of Ukrainian rankings for Shelly, each page\n# being a list of BrawlerRanking model where 0 < len(page) <= 10\npages = client.page_brawler_rankings(\n    brawling.BrawlerID.SHELLY,\n    per_page=10, region=\'ua\', max=200\n)\n\n# ^ Note that this operation was immediate,\n# as no data is fetched yet.\n\n# This will now fetch pages of 10 players,\n# until either there are no players left,\n# or we reach the max limit of 200.\n\n# NOTE: Due to limitations of the API, page methods can return only return\n# as many objects as get_* methods, so the only use for them is to\n# minimize the traffic if you only need to retrieve a few objects.\nfor page in pages:\n    print(page)\n```\n\nThe client has additional options you can use when initializing:\n\n```py\nClient(TOKEN, proxy=True, strict_errors=False, force_no_cache=True, force_no_sort=True)\n```\n\nWith `strict_errors` set to False, the API methods can now silently fail instead of raising exceptions, and instead return an `ErrorResponse` object. It\'s your job to handle it.\n\nThe `proxy` argument will use a [3rd party proxy](https://docs.royaleapi.com/#/proxy). Details on setting up are on the linked page. DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible for anything related to the proxy. I am not in any way related to its developers, and it\'s not my fault if your API access gets blocked because of using it.\n\n`force_no_cache` will disable the caching of requests no matter what. This setting is useless if you didn\'t install with `brawling[cache]`, and otherwise is only recommended if you\'re facing issues because of the cache (such as non-up-to-date responses)\n\nBy default, some methods that return a list will attempt to sort it. `force_no_sort` will disable that, and return everything in the exact order as it was received. Note that for now, only `get_battle_log` does any sorting, because the other methods already give out a sorted list. This is undocumented and may change at any time though, but I still decided that I won\'t add sorting to all the other methods, due to being a potentially useless performance decrease.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis content is not affiliated with, endorsed, sponsored, or specifically approved by Supercell and Supercell is not responsible for it.
