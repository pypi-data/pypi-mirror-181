# opentelemetry_wrapper

a wrapper around `opentelemetry` and `opentelemetry-instrumentation-*` to make life a bit easier

## what this does (or is supposed to do)

* Make instrumentation (more) idempotent
* Make re-instrumentation of logging actually work with different format strings
* Make `logging` print as a one-line JSON dict by default
* Provide support for decorating functions and classes
* Provide support for instrumentation of dataclasses
    * Global instrumentation needs to be run *before* any dataclasses are initialized
    * Otherwise, use the decorator on each class as usual (it's idempotent anyway)
* Add global instrumentation of FastAPI
    * sometimes works even after apps are created for some reason, likely due to how Uvicorn runs in a new process
    * but somehow sometimes doesn't work in prod, for equally unknown reasons
    * probably best to instrument each app instance
* logs some http headers received by fastapi as span attributes

| Variable Name                 | Description                                                                                                                              | Default (if not set)                                                |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | Looks like `http://tempo.localhost:4317`.                                                                                                | *NA* (traces are not exported to any OTLP endpoint)                 |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADER`   | Looks like `Header-Name=header value`, where values can contain space. To insert multiple headers, delimit by any other whitespace char. | *NA* (no header sent to OTLP endpoint)                              |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` | Set to `true` to disable SSL for OTLP trace exports.                                                                                     | *NA* (no header sent to OTLP endpoint)                              |
| `OTEL_HEADER_ATTRIBUTES`      | HTTP headers to extract as span attributes, split by whitespace.                                                                         | see **header_attributes.py**                                        |
| `OTEL_LOG_LEVEL`              | Log level used by the logging instrumentor.                                                                                              | `INFO`                                                              |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`    | Key-value pairs to be used as resource attributes.                                                                                       | *NA*                                                                |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`           | Sets the value of the `service.name` resource attribute.                                                                                 | f'{username}@{hostname}.{namespace or domain}:<{filename of main}>' |
| `OTEL_WRAPPER_DISABLED`       | Set to `true` to disable tracing globally (e.g. when running pytest).                                                                    | `false` (tracing is enabled)                                        |
