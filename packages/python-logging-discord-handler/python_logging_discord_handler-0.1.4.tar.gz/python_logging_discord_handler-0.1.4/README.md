# Python logging handler for Discord

Redirect your Python log output to Discord using [Python logging subsystem](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html) and [Discord Webhook library](https://github.com/lovvskillz/python-discord-webhook).

![Example screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tradingstrategy-ai/python-logging-discord-handler/master/docs/source/_static/example_screenshot.png)

# Use cases

- Easily share logs with non-technical colleagues
- Get notified on server-side errors
- Follow your batch job processes easily
- Good for businesses and communities that have their messaging set up in Discord 

# Features

- Minimum or no changes to a Python application needed
- Optional color coding of messages using [Discord embeds](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#embed-preview)
- Optional emoticons on messages using Unicode
- Discord rate limiting friendly for burst of logs
- [Documentation](https://python-logging-discord-handler.readthedocs.io/)
- Special handling for long log messages like tracebacks to deal with Discord's 2000 character max message length

# Requirements

- Python 3.8+

# Installation 

[With pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```shell
pip install python-logging-discord-handler
```

[With Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```shell
poetry add python-logging-discord-handler
```

# Usage

This example logs both to Discord and standard output. 

First you need to 

```python
import logging

from discord_logging.handler import DiscordHandler

# See instructions below how to get a Webhook URL
webhook_url = # ...
logger = logging.getLogger()

stream_format = logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
discord_format = logging.Formatter("%(message)s")

discord_handler = DiscordHandler(
    "Hello World Bot", 
    webhook_url, 
    avatar_url="https://i0.wp.com/www.theterminatorfans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/the-terminator3.jpg?resize=900%2C450&ssl=1")

#discord_handler = DiscordHandler("Happy Bot", webhook_url, emojis={})
discord_handler.setFormatter(discord_format)
stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(stream_format)

# Add the handlers to the Logger
logger.addHandler(discord_handler)
logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.debug("A debug message - usually not that interesting")
logger.error("Very nasty error messgae!")
```

# How to get Discord webhook URL

1. Go to *Edit channel* (gear) in Discord
2. Choose *Integrations*
3. Choose *View webhooks* -> *New*
4. Copy URL

## Webhook URL security

It is recommend that you store the webhook URL outside your source code to avoid damage in hacks or similar security incidents.

In Linux/macOS shell you can do on the command line:

```shell
export DISCORD_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL=<your webhook URL here>
```

For long term configuration, you can create a file storing environment variables outside your source code tree, like in your home directory. Store the `export` commands there.

```shell
# Text editor for a secrets.env file in your home directory on Linux
nano ~/secrets.env  
```

In your Linux shell session, you can then read this file and make environment variables effective using [source](https://superuser.com/a/46149) command in your shell:

```shell
# Reads secrets.env and executes all commands there and makes them effective
# in the current shell session
source ~/secrets.env
```

Then you can read the environment variable in your Python code: 

```python
import os

webhook_url = os.environ["DISCORD_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL"]
```

# Discord limitations

- Max 2000 characters per message. See API documentation how to work around this limitation with different options. By default the bottom most lines of the log message, like a traceback, are shown.
- Discord embeds, those that give you a logging level color bar on the left, have very hard time to deal with long lines. Embeds are disabled for long lines by default.

## Log output formatting logic

The log message are converted to Discord embeds with the following logic

- Single line log messsages are converted to embed titles
- For multi line log messages, the first line is the embed title and the following lines are the embed description
- Long lines or long messages cannot be convert to embeds, instead they use [Discord Markdown code formattiong](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) to preserve the readability of the output
- A special `message_break_char` can be assigned to manually split long messages 

# Colours and emoticons

Logging messages can be decorated with colours and emoticons.

![Emoji screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tradingstrategy-ai/python-logging-discord-handler/master/docs/source/_static/emoji_example.png)


Here are the defaults:

```python
#: The default log level colors as hexacimal, converted int
DEFAULT_COLOURS = {
    None: 2040357,  # Unknown log level
    logging.CRITICAL: 14362664,  # Red
    logging.ERROR: 14362664,  # Red
    logging.WARNING: 16497928,  # Yellow
    logging.INFO: 2196944,  # Blue
    logging.DEBUG: 8947848,  # Gray
}


#: The default log emojis as
DEFAULT_EMOJIS = {
    None: "",  # Unknown log level
    logging.CRITICAL: "üÜò",
    logging.ERROR: "‚ùå",
    logging.WARNING: "‚ö†Ô∏è",
    logging.INFO: "",
    logging.DEBUG: "",
}
```

Emoticons are disabled by default as they often make the output a bit too colourful and harder to read.

# Testing and development

## Manual tests

Inspect how logging output looks in Discord.

- Checkout this Git repository
- Set up a dummy Discord channel
- Get its webhook URL

```shell
poetry install -E docs 
export DISCORD_TEST_WEBHOOK_URL=...
python discord_logging/examples.py
```

This will dump some messages to your Discord.

## Automated tests

Run:

```shell
pytest
```
