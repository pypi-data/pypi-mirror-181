# Introduction
Automation in quantum software testing is essential to support systematic and cost-effective testing. Towards this direction, we present a quantum software testing tool called Quito that can automatically generate test suites covering three coverage criteria defined on inputs and outputs of a quantum program coded in Qiskit, i.e., input coverage, output coverage, and input-output coverage. Quito also implements two types of test oracles based on program specifications, i.e., checking whether a quantum program produced a wrong output or checking a probabilistic test oracle with statistical test.
