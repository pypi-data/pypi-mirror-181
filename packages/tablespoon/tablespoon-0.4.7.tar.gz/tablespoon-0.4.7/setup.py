If you are looking for an\nimpressive probabilistic forecasting package see the list of recommendation at\nthe bottom of this README. This package is <b>exceptionally ordinary</b>. It is\nexpected that this package may be used as a compliment to what is already out\nthere.\n\n# Why Run Simple Methods\n\nWe have found, by experience, many good uses for the methods in this package.\nTo often we see that forecast methods go in production without a naive method to\naccompany it. This is a missed opportunity.\n\n1. **Naive May Be Good Enough**: How good is good enough? I have almost never started a project where the firm receiving the forecast knew the answer to this question, but it is important to get to it early. I think all of us would agree that a forecast error of 0 is best, but in reality how much time should be spent spinning our wheels to get there. Further, many business applications can‚Äôt be improved upon even with significant forecast error reduction. I remember hearing a story of a firm which ordered units on pallets. The firm paid by the pallet, not the unit. The forecast team was able to reduce the forecast error, but in the end this did not change the outcome. This is the ‚Äòpallet problem‚Äô. As data scientists it is easy to think of error reduction as a continuous function, but this need not map the same way to business value. In this example the continuous error reduction mapped to a discrete pallet. This is a long way of saying, ‚ÄúA naive forecast may be good enough‚Äù. What is a naive forecasting method? I typically think of two methods. The mean forecast and the naive forecast. I will go over these in more detail below. There are also some applications where naive methods have been shown to be hard to beat.\n2. **Get A Denominator for Relative Metrics**: Though naive methods can usually\n   be beat it is good to know the relative improvement over the benchmark. This\n   can allow a forecasting team to market their alternative forecast when the\n   \'skill score\' is impressive.\n3. **Easy to productionize and get expectations**: Get a sense for *how good is\n   good enough*. In many applications a forecast team is asked to forecast, but\n   stakeholders provide no line-in-the-sand for when the forecasting work needs\n   to stop. One reasonable approach is to run the benchmarks found in this\n   package then beat the best performing benchmark by a margin that is\n   statistically significant.\n4. **Resilience in Production - Why not have many models?**: Sometimes, despite\n   best efforts the production model does something unexpected. In this\n   case it is nice to have a simple backup that is cheap to generate and good\n   enough to fall back on. In this way a production forecast pipeline gains\n   strength from a diversity of models.\n5. **Easy Uncertainty Quantification**: Recently we see that applications\n   are not about forecast accuracy, but instead about forecasting uncertainty.\n   Capturing the full distribution helps firms set "service levels" aka\n   percentiles of the distribution for which they are prepared to serve. Even\n   if you have the worlds most accurate unbiased forecast the median point is\n   , by definition, an underforecast half the time. For this reason it is best to provide a\n   distribution of simulated future values and the firm may decide for\n   themselves what risks they are or are not willing to take.\n\n# Quick Example\n\nWe show a quick example below. \n\nFor more examples see [Simple Example](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/plotting/), [Extended Example](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/extended/)\n\nThere are also some Notebook examples\n1. [Intro](https://github.com/alexhallam/tablespoon/blob/main/examples/tablespoon.ipynb)\n2. [Time Series Cross Validation & Skill Score](https://github.com/alexhallam/tablespoon/blob/main/examples/time_series_cv.ipynb)\n### Seasonal Example\n\n```python\nimport tablespoon as tbsp\nfrom tablespoon.data import SEAS\n\nsn = tbsp.Snaive()\ndf_sn = sn.predict(\n    SEAS, horizon=7 * 4, frequency="D", lag=7, uncertainty_samples=8000\n).assign(model="snaive")\n\nprint(df_sn.head(10))\n```\n\n### Stock Prediction\n\n```python\nimport tablespoon as tbsp\nfrom tablespoon.data import APPL\n\nn = tbsp.Naive()\ndf_n = n.predict(\n    APPL, horizon=7 * 4, frequency="D", lag=1, uncertainty_samples=8000\n).assign(model="naive")\n\nprint(df_n.head(10))\n```\n\n```sh\n          ds  rep    y_sim  model\n0 2022-01-02    0  5.20006  naive\n1 2022-01-02    1  5.16789  naive\n2 2022-01-02    2  5.17641  naive\n3 2022-01-02    3  5.19340  naive\n4 2022-01-02    4  5.20075  naive\n5 2022-01-02    5  5.17681  naive\n6 2022-01-02    6  5.20302  naive\n7 2022-01-02    7  5.18896  naive\n8 2022-01-02    8  5.19622  naive\n9 2022-01-02    9  5.17469  naive\n```\n<p align="center"><img align="center" src="assets/forecasts_n.jpg" width="800" /></p>\n\n\n\n\n# Goals of this package\n\n1. ‚ôô**Simple**: Not just in the forecasts themselves, but also from the\n   users perspective.\n2. ‚ôù**Documented**: It should be very clear exactly how forecasts are getting\n   generated. We document the parameterization of the models to make this as\n   obvious and uninteresting as possible. See [Forecast Method Math Documentation](https://alexhallam.github.io/tablespoon/section/math/)\n3. ‚ôú**Stable**: We want this package to feel rock solid. For this to happen\n   we keep the feature set relatively small. We believe that after the initial \n   development of this package we should spend out time maintaining the code as\n   oppose to thinking of new features.\n4. ‚ôû**Distributional**: Quantification of uncertainty is the name of\n   the game.\n\n# Non-Goals\n\n1. üî•**Circut Melting Focus on Speed**: Not to say this is a slow package. In fact, it is very fast! \n   We just don\'t put any extra effort to make it faster than `numpy`.\n2. ü§ñ**New/Complex Forecast Models**: Again, this is out of scope.
