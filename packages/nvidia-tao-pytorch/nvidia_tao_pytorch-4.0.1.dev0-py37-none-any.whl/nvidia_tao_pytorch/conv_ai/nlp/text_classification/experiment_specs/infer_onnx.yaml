  - 'by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster .'
  - 'director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one .'
  - 'uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .'
  - "I love exotic science fiction / fantasy movies but this one was very unpleasant to watch . Suggestions and images of child abuse , mutilated bodies (live or dead) , other gruesome scenes , plot holes , boring acting made this a regretable experience , The basic idea of entering another person's mind is not even new to the movies or TV (An Outer Limits episode was better at exploring this idea) . i gave it 4 / 10 since some special effects were nice ."
