        Methods
        -------
        nh_lagranges_equations:
        This method uses attributes defined in the __init__ method to perform the operations associated with nonholonomic Lagranges equations.

        make_states:
        This method uses attributes to reduce the order of the equations of motion from second order to first order for each coordinate. This method relies on 
        sympy and it's derivative function. 

        get_alpha:
        This method is used to obtain the alpha_hk terms shown in the nonholonomic lagrange equations.
        the constraint attribute is used in the .coeff() method.

        Attributes
        ----------
        Lagrangian: The Lagragian, L, defined as L=T-V. Where T is the total kinetic energy and V is the total potential energy. This must be entered into the constructor.

        Coordinates: These are the coordinates of the system. Example: x,y,z. These must be entered into the constructor

        Coordinate Derivatives: The derivatives of the coordinates mentioned above. Example: x'(t), y'(t), z'(t). These must be entered into the constructor.

        Optional Attributes
        -------------------

        State Variables: The varibles the user chooses to use for state space representation. This attribute is set to none by default. If there are no states defined, the get_states
                          method will not apply. An error will be raised.

        Constraint Equations: The nonholonomic constraints of the system or model. These equations are optional and the default is none. If there are no constraints defined,
        the get_alpha method will raise an error

        k: this is the number of coordinates that are independent of the constraint equations. This is only needed for nonholonomic lagrange equations

        m: this is the number of nonholonomic constraints in the system.

        Note:
        -----
        Currently, complete functionality is only reasonable for small holonomic linear systems. This is due to the fact that the user must manually type the state equations into an ODE solver.
        Additionally, nonlinear systems requre separate ODE solvers and nonlinearity detection has not been implemented yet. However, obtaining the equation of motion is still available for use. 
        The solution to the equation of motion is available outside of this module by means of the user.
