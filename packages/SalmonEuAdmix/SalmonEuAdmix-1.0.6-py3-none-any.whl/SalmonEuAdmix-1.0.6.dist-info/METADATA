SalmonEuAdmix: a machine learning-based library for estimating European admixture proportions in Atlantic salmon. 

SalmonEuAdmix is a program designed to streamline the admixture estimation process, 
and allow for European admixture proporions to be accurately estimated from a 
parsimonious set of SNP markers. Relying exlusively on the genotypes for the set 
of SNPs as input, SalmonEuAdmix can predict admixture proporions for novel samples. 
The program utilizes a machine-learning model trained on pairs of genotypes and 
admixture proportions for 5812 individuals encompassing a mixture of wild and 
aquaculture fish of European, North American, and mixed ancestry. The model has 
been experimentally show to predict admixture proportions that conform to the 
estimations provided by a complete admixture analysis with greater than 98 percent accuracy.
