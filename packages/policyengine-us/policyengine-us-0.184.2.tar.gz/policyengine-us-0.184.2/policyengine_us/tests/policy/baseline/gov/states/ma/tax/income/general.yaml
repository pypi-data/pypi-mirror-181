    # TAXSIM35 10/24/22 version generates for this case a MA income tax
    # of zero, which is clearly incorrect.
    #
    # DETAILS:
    # Deductions reduce PartB taxable income (on wages and interest) to
    # zero, leaving the $4400 personal exemption completely unused.
    # Under MA law, the unused (or excess) exemption if first used
    # to reduce the $2010 in PartA STCG to zero.  But that leaves a
    # $2390 unused exemption, which can then be used to reduce the
    # $10,010 in LTCG to $7620 in PartC taxable income.  The flat PartC
    # tax rate is 5.00% in 2021, so the MA income tax amount for this case
    # is $381.  It is this last reduction that is missing in PolicyEngineUS.
    #
    # REFERENCE:
    # That an unused (or excess) PartB exemption can be used to reduce BOTH
    # PartA and PartC income is described in the document at this URL:
    # https://www.mass.gov/service-details/view-massachusetts-personal-income-tax-exemption
