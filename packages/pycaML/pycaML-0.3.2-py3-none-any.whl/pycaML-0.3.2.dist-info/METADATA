pycaML is an easy machine learning model comparison tool with optimization. It allows to generate a table comparing multiple machine learning models, to see which one is best for your data. The unique feature of pycaML is built-in hyperparameters tuning using Bayesian Optimization. It also supports meta-models like Stacking and Voting ensembles. You can setup and optimize 25 models with one line of code.
