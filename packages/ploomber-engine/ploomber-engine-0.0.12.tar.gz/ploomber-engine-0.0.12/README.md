# ploomber-engine

Add debugging and profiling capabilities to [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill).

`ploomber-engine` adds new capabilities to papermill via custom engines, they're described below.

## Engines

- [debuglater](#debug-later)
- [debug](#debug-now)
- [profiling](#notebook-profiling-cpu-gpu-ram)

## Installation

```sh
pip install ploomber-engine
```
## Debug later

This engine uses our [debuglater](https://github.com/ploomber/debuglater) package to serialize the error traceback so you can start a debugging session whenever possible.

So, for example, if you're running notebooks in production or remote servers, you can debug them upon crashing. Likewise, you can use the generated file to debug on a different machine (assuming the environment is the same) without having access to the source code.

### Debug later example

```sh
# install package (this installs papermill as well)
pip install ploomber-engine

# get sample notebook
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ploomber/ploomber-engine/main/tests/assets/debuglater.ipynb
```

Run the notebook with `--engine debuglater`

```sh tags=['raises-exception']
papermill debuglater.ipynb tmp.ipynb --engine debuglater
```

Start debugging session (using `debuglater` CLI)

<!-- #region -->
```
dltr jupyter.dump
```
<!-- #endregion -->

## Debug now

This engine will automatically start a debugging session upon notebook crash.

### Debug now example

```sh
# install package (this installs papermill as well)
pip install ploomber-engine

# get the example notebook
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ploomber/ploomber-engine/main/tests/assets/crash.ipynb
```

Run the notebook with the custom engine:

```sh tags=['raises-exception']
papermill crash.ipynb tmp.ipynb --engine debug
```


Once the notebook crashes, it'll start the debugging session:

```
Input Notebook:  crash.ipynb
Output Notebook: tmp.ipynb

      1 x = 1
      2 y = 0

```

## Notebook profiling (CPU, GPU, RAM)

Papermill executes the notebook in an independent process. We built an engine that runs a notebook in the same process, which enables resource monitoring.
