Comprehensive construction of empCpds via generic tree structures (khipu).

        2) Get minimum_spanning_tree, i.e. non-redundant adduct_edges from (U, B),

        Notes

        It's not a simple grid of combinations of isotope_search_patterns, adduct_search_patterns,

        Tree search methods don't always cover all edges, not a good choice.
        If minimum_spanning_tree is calculated from self.input_network, the isotopic branch may not be fully connect.

        Enforce unique node per grid, by best rtime with future option of a fitness function. 
        Extra nodes go to a new khipu.
        Designate feature of lowest m/z as root, which is often M+H+ or M-,  
        as we do not include lower mz in the initial search.
        A root is not necessarily M0, which may not be detected in perfect labeling experiments.
