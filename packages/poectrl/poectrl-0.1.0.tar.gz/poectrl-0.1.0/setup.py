BE VERY CAREFUL that you\nchoose the correct voltage for your devices or you can DAMAGE THEM. No\nresponsibility is taken for equipment damaged using this library.**\n\n- [Status](#status)\n- [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Development Plans](#development-plans)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Status\n\nThis project is in no way ready to be used, and documentation is non-existent.\nSee the Development Plans below. Until I have a stable useful interface, check\nthe source code if you are interested ðŸ˜ƒ\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- Control a set of PoE-powered IP cameras, switches and access points to allow\ndisabling when not needed or quick enabling if required.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe program is configured using a `poectrl.json` file either in the current\nworking directory (first priority) or the user\'s home directory. This is a\nsimple file that describes all devices and profiles. There is an example in\n[poectrl-example.json](poectrl-example.json) :\n\n```json\n{\n  "devices": {\n    "192.168.0.187": {"user": "ubnt", "password": "ubnt"},\n    "192.168.0.190": {"user": "ubnt", "password": "ubnt"}\n  },\n  "profiles": {\n    "cctv_on": {\n      "192.168.0.187": {"4": 24,"5": 24,"8": 48},\n      "192.168.0.190": {"5": 24,"6": 24,"7": 48}\n    },\n    "cctv_off": {\n      "192.168.0.187": {"4": 0,"5": 0,"8": 0},\n      "192.168.0.190": {"5": 0,"6": 0,"7": 0}\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nApply a predefined profile, setting the PoE port voltages.\n\n```console\n$ ./poectrl apply cctv_off\nUsing configuration from /home/seapagan/data/work/own/ts-8-pro-control/poectrl.json\nConncting to 192.168.0.187:\n  Setting port 4 to 0V\n  Setting port 5 to 0V\n  Setting port 8 to 0V\nConncting to 192.168.0.190:\n  Setting port 5 to 0V\n  Setting port 6 to 0V\n  Setting port 7 to 0V\n```\n\nList all defined profiles:\n\n```console\n$ ./poectrl list\nUsing configuration from /home/seapagan/data/work/own/ts-8-pro-control/poectrl.json\n\nValid profiles are :\n - cctv_on\n - cctv_off\n```\n\nShow settings for a profile :\n\n```console\n$ ./poectrl show cctv_off\nUsing configuration from /home/seapagan/data/work/own/ts-8-pro-control/poectrl.json\n{\n    "192.168.0.187": {\n        "4": 0,\n        "5": 0,\n        "8": 0\n    },\n    "192.168.0.190": {\n        "5": 0,\n        "6": 0,\n        "7": 0\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## Development Plans\n\nCurrent proposed project plan.\n\n- [x] Write proof-of-concept code to control ports.\n- [x] Refactor and tidy the above code into a Library Class.\n- [x] Create a basic CLI using this Library\n- [x] Continue the CLI to use a config file, show current values, list profiles\n  etc.\n- [x] Publish on PyPi as a standalone package.\n- [ ] Develop this into a full API (using FastAPI).\n- [ ] Modify the command line app to interface with the above API.\n- [ ] Create a Web App to interface with the above API.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAt this time, the project is barely in it\'s planning stage but I do have a firm\nidea where it\'s going and how to structure it. As such, other contributions are\nnot looked for at this time. Hopefully, within a few days this project will be\nat a much more advanced stage and that will change ðŸ˜ƒ.\n',
