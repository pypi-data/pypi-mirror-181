Generate documentation in (github style unless told otherwise) markdown format following the following instructions:

{instructions}

Your response must be json in this (simplified) schema, with one object per file you wish to output:

```json
    [{{
    "filename": <filename: string>,
    "doc": <documentation: string>
    }}]
```

You are an expert, ensure that your answer is technically correct, succinct, well documented and formatted.
