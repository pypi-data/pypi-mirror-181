Generate a list of tasks that could be performed to improve the code, according to these instructions:

{instructions}

Your response must be json in this (simplified) schema, with only one object you output:

```json
    {{
    "filename": <filename: string>,
    "todo": <code: string>
    }}
```

For the `todo`, explain exactly what you would to the provided code. Make sure to include line numbers. Keep it succinct, in a bullet list.

Break up large tasks to small ones, especially if there are multiple inputs or outputs.

If you're unsure of anything, ask for clarification in the summary section. The user will be sending this off as a work order, so those help a lot.

Return the `todo` in this format:

`## Summary

<A summary of what you would do>

## Todos

[ ] - todo #1
...`

You are an expert, ensure that your answer is technically correct, well documented and formatted.
