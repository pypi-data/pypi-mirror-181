# ndcc - NFL Draft Capital Comparator

A simple CLI App
 to compare the value
 of up to 32 NFL draft pick collections
 with one another.
 This can be useful when trying to determine
 which team in the draft has the most draft capital,
 or by how much a team increased
 or decreased their capital
 with their draft day (pick) trades.
 The most obvious use case however is to determine
 who won a pick trade according to different value charts.

For now,
 these are the charts one can choose between to determine value:

* [Jimmy Johnson](https://www.drafttek.com/nfl-trade-value-chart.asp)
* [Rich Hill](https://www.drafttek.com/NFL-Trade-Value-Chart-Rich-Hill.asp)
* [Fitzgerald/Spielberger](https://overthecap.com/draft-trade-value-chart/)
* [Kevin Meers (Harvard Sports Analysis)](https://harvardsportsanalysis.wordpress.com/2011/11/30/how-to-value-nfl-draft-picks/)
* [PFF WAR](https://www.pff.com/news/draft-pff-data-study-breaking-down-every-nfl-teams-draft-capital-jacksonville-jaguars)
* [Michael Lopez (blended curve)](https://statsbylopez.netlify.app/post/rethinking-draft-curve/)
* [Chase Stuart](http://www.footballperspective.com/draft-value-chart/)

To account for drafts with a lot of compensatory picks,
 each chart is "prolonged" to 270 picks,
 using estimates on what the remaining values would be.

## installation

```sh
pip install ndcc
```

## usage

```sh
python -m ndcc
```

## adding charts

To add another chart,
 simply add a column in charts.csv,
 fill in the values
 and add the column name
 and chart name
 you want to be presented with
 to the values
 (and default_values,
 if you want the chart to be selected by default)
 of the checkboxlist_dialog
 in input.get_selected_charts().
