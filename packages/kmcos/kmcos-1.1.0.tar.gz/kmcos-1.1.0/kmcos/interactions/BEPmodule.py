#this class is for BEP  relation objects.
#The reason to have a class is because then we can make functions inside of it and also data structures.
# we can have a person provide a bunch of Ea and DeltaHRxn points,  and then they can apply a class function to fit it.
#they can then also use a function to predict the Ea under other conditions etc.
#one thing to note is that a BEPrelation can be defined by alpha and beta, or by DeltaHRxn and "alpha" (through using E0 in the derivation, which is the activation energy when the DeltaHRxn happens to be 0).
#  this class requires alpha and beta to be provided to create a BEP relation object,  but it should later have a function added that can be used to make an object using DeltaHRxn and alpha.

#TODO: create function to make a BEPrelation object from DeltaHRxn and alpha.
