# CRISPRCasTyper

Detect CRISPR-Cas genes and arrays, and predict the subtype based on both Cas genes and CRISPR repeat sequence.

[CRISPRCasTyper and RepeatType are also available through a webserver](https://crisprcastyper.crispr.dk)

This software finds Cas genes with a large suite of HMMs, then groups these HMMs into operons, and predicts the subtype of the operons based on a scoring scheme.
Furthermore, it finds CRISPR arrays with [minced](https://github.com/ctSkennerton/minced) and by BLASTing a large suite of known repeats, and using a kmer-based machine learning approach (extreme gradient boosting trees) it predicts the subtype of the CRISPR arrays based on the consensus repeat. 
It then connects the Cas operons and CRISPR arrays, producing as output:
* CRISPR-Cas loci, with consensus subtype prediction based on both Cas genes (mostly) and CRISPR consensus repeats
* Orphan Cas operons, and their predicted subtype
* Orphan CRISPR arrays, and their predicted associated subtype

#### It includes the following 46 subtypes/variants [(find typing scheme here)](https://typer.crispr.dk/#/typing):
* I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D, I-E, I-F, I-F (transposon), I-G, II-A, II-B, II-C, III-A, III-B, III-C, III-D, III-E, III-F, IV-A1, IV-A2, IV-A3, IV-B, IV-C, IV-D, IV-E, V-A, V-B1, V-B2, V-C, V-D, V-E, V-F1, V-F2, V-F3, V-F (the rest), V-G, V-H, V-I, V-J, V-K, V-L, VI-A, VI-B1, VI-B2, VI-C, VI-D, VI-X, VI-Y. 

* All subtypes from the most recent Nature Reviews Microbiology (Makarova et al. 2020): [Evolutionary classification of CRISPR–Cas systems: a burst of class 2 and derived variants](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-019-0299-x)
* Updated type IV subtypes and variants based on: [Type IV CRISPR–Cas systems are highly diverse and involved in competition between plasmids](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1197)
* Type V-K: [RNA-guided DNA insertion with CRISPR-associated transposases](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aax9181)
* Transposon associated type I-F: [Transposon-encoded CRISPR–Cas systems direct RNA-guided DNA integration](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1323-z)
* New V-A variants: [Novel Type V-A CRISPR Effectors Are Active Nucleases with Expanded Targeting Capabilities](https://doi.org/10.1089/crispr.2020.0043)
* New Cas13s: [Programmable RNA editing with compact CRISPR–Cas13 systems from uncultivated microbes](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01124-4)

## Quick start <a name="quick"></a>

```sh
conda create -n cctyper -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c russel88 cctyper
conda activate cctyper
cctyper my.fasta my_output
```

## Installation <a name="install"></a>
CRISPRCasTyper can be installed either through conda or pip.

It is advised to use conda, since this installs CRISPRCasTyper and all dependencies, and downloads the database in one go.

### Conda
Use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to install.

Create the environment with CRISPRCasTyper and all dependencies and database
```sh
conda create -n cctyper -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c russel88 cctyper
```

### pip
If you have the dependencies (Python >= 3.8, HMMER >= 3.2, Prodigal >= 2.6, minced, grep, sed) in your PATH you can install with pip

Install cctyper python module
```sh
python -m pip install cctyper
```

Upgrade cctyper python module to the latest version
```sh
python -m pip install cctyper --upgrade
```


#### When installing with pip, you need to download the database manually: 
```sh
# Download and unpack
svn checkout https://github.com/Russel88/CRISPRCasTyper/trunk/data
tar -xvzf data/Profiles.tar.gz
mv Profiles/ data/
rm data/Profiles.tar.gz

# Tell CRISPRCasTyper where the data is:
# either by setting an environment variable (has to be done for each terminal session, or added to .bashrc):
export CCTYPER_DB="/path/to/data/"
# or by using the --db argument each time you run CRISPRCasTyper:
cctyper input.fa output --db /path/to/data/
```

## CRISPRCasTyper - How to <a name="cctyperhow"></a>
CRISPRCasTyper takes as input a nucleotide fasta, and produces outputs with CRISPR-Cas predictions

#### Activate environment
```sh
conda activate cctyper
```

#### Run with a nucleotide fasta as input
```sh
cctyper genome.fa my_output
```

#### If you have a complete circular genome (each entry in the fasta will be treated as having circular topology)
```sh
cctyper genome.fa my_output --circular
```

#### For metagenome assemblies and short contigs/plasmids/phages, change the prodigal mode
The default prodigal mode expects the input to be a single draft or complete genome
```sh
cctyper assembly.fa my_output --prodigal meta
```

#### Check the different options
```sh
cctyper -h
```

#### Notes on output
Files are only created if there is any data. For example, the CRISPR_Cas.tab file is only created if there are any CRISPR-Cas loci. 

### Plotting <a name="plot"></a>
CRISPRCasTyper will automatically plot a map of the CRISPR-Cas loci, orphan Cas operons, and orphan CRISPR arrays.

These maps can be expanded (`--expand N`) by adding unknown genes and genes with alignment scores below the thresholds. This can help in identify potentially un-annotated genes in operons. You can generate new plots without having to re-run the entire pipeline by adding `--redo_typing` to the command. This will re-use the mappings and re-type the operons and re-make the plot, based on new thresholds and plot parameters.

The plot below is run with `--expand 5000`

* Arrays are in alternating black/white displaying the actual number of repeats/spacers, and with their predicted subtype association based on the consensus repeat sequence.
* The interference module is in yellow.
* The adaptation module is in blue.
* Cas6 is in red.
* Accessory genes are in purple
* Genes with alignment scores below the thresholds are lighter and with parentheses around names.
* Unknown genes are in gray (the number matches the genes.tab file)

## RepeatTyper - How to <a name="repeattype"></a>
With an input of CRISPR repeats (one per line, in a simple textfile) RepeatTyper will predict the subtype, based on the kmer composition of the repeat

#### Activate environment
```sh
conda activate cctyper
```

#### Run with a simple textfile, containing only CRISPR repeats (in capital letters), one repeat per line.
```sh
repeatType repeats.txt
```

#### Output <a name="repeattypeout"></a>
The script prints:
* Repeat sequence
* Predicted subtype
* Probability of prediction

#### Notes on output
* Predictions with probabilities below 0.75 are uncertain, and should be taken with a grain of salt.
* Prior to version 1.4.0 the curated repeatTyper model was included in CCTyper
* From version 1.4.0 and onwards updated repeatTyper models are included in CCTyper (see more information in the section below)
* The followinig subtypes are included in the updated model as per December 2022:
    * I-A, I-B, I-C, I-D, I-E, I-F, I-F (Transposon), I-G
    * II-A, II-B, II-C
    * III-A, III-B, III-C, III-D, III-E, III-F
    * IV-A1, IV-A2, IV-A3, IV-D, IV-E
    * V-A, V-B1, V-E, V-F1, V-F2, V-F3, V-F (the rest), V-G, V-I, V-J, V-K
    * VI-A, VI-B1, VI-B2, VI-C, VI-D
* This is the accuracy per subtype (on an unseen test dataset):
* I-A      0.76
* I-B      0.81
* I-C      0.97
* I-D      0.86

### Updated RepeatTyper models <a name="repeatnew"></a>
The [CCTyper webserver](https://typer.crispr.dk) is crowdsourcing subtyped repeats and includes an updated RepeatTyper model based on a much larger set of repeats and contains additional subtypes compared to the curated RepeatTyper model. 
This updated model is automatically retrained each month and the models can be downloaded [here](http://mibi.galaxy.bio.ku.dk/russel/repeattyper/).

From version 1.4.0 and onwards of CCTyper the newest repeatTyper model is included upon release of the version.

Each model contains a training report (xgb_report), where you can find the training log, and in the bottom the accuracy, both overall and per subtype.

#### Use new model in CRISPRCasTyper
Save the original database files:
```sh
mv ${CCTYPER_DB}/type_dict.tab ${CCTYPER_DB}/type_dict_orig.tab
mv ${CCTYPER_DB}/xgb_repeats.model ${CCTYPER_DB}/xgb_repeats_orig.model
```

Move the new model into the database folder
```sh
mv repeat_model/* ${CCTYPER_DB}/
```

##### CRISPRCasTyper and RepeatTyper will now use the new model for repeat prediction!

## RepeatTyper - Train <a name="repeattrain"></a>
You can train the repeat classifier with your own set of subtyped repeats. With a tab-delimeted input where 1. column contains the subtypes and 2. column contains the CRISPR repeat sequences, RepeatTrain will train a CRISPR repeat classifier that is directly usable for both RepeatTyper and CRISPRCasTyper.

#### Train
```sh
repeatTrain typed_repeats.tab my_classifier
```

#### Use new model in RepeatTyper
```sh
repeatType repeats.txt --db my_classifier
```

#### Use new model in CRISPRCasTyper
Save the original database files:
```sh
mv ${CCTYPER_DB}/type_dict.tab ${CCTYPER_DB}/type_dict_orig.tab
mv ${CCTYPER_DB}/xgb_repeats.model ${CCTYPER_DB}/xgb_repeats_orig.model
```

Move the new model into the database folder
```sh
mv my_classifier/* ${CCTYPER_DB}/
```

##### CRISPRCasTyper and RepeatTyper will now use the new model for repeat prediction!

## Troubleshoot <a name="trouble"></a>

### Running out of memory
Large metagenomic assemblies with many small contigs can exhaust the RAM on your laptop. Fortunately, as metagenomic contigs are analysed separately (when run with `--prodigal meta`) a simple solution is to split the input into smaller chunks (e.g. with [pyfasta](https://pypi.org/project/pyfasta/#command-line-interface))
