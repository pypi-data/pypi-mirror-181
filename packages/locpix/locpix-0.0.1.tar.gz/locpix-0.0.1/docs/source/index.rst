#. Manually annotating these histograms to extract relevant localisations :ref:`annotate`
#. Labelling histogram with seeds for watershed algorithm :ref:`get-markers`
#. Utilising Classic method, Cellpose and Ilastik to segment the histograms to extract relevant localisations :ref:`classic-segmentation`, :ref:`cellpose-segmentation` and :ref:`ilastik-segmentation`
#. Performance metrics calculation based on the localisations (not the histograms!) :ref:`membrane-performance`
