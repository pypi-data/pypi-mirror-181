Description: # GPROF-NN
        
        This Python package implements the GPROF-NN retrieval algorithms for the passive
        microwave observations of GPM.
        
        ## Overview
        
        This package provides a command line application, which implements the principal
        data preparation, training and retrieval functionality of GPROF-NN. In addition
        to that, the ``gprof_nn`` python package provides utility functions for the
        processing of GPM-related data.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        Running any of the released GPROF-NN retrievals should by as easy as
        ````
        pip install -U gprof_nn                # Install gprof_nn
        gprof_nn hr l1c_file.HDF5 -o output.nc # Run retrieval
        ````
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Detailed documentation is available on
        [readthedocs](https://gprof-nn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
