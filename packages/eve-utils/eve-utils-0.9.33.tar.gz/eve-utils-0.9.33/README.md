# eve-utils
Templates and scripts to rapidly spin up a production-ready Eve-based API.

> **Please note**:  although I currently use these tools to create production-ready APIs, the tools themselves are still under development.  Use at your own risk.



## Introduction

[Eve](https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/) is amazing.  The full power of Flask/Python, optimized for an API over mongodb.  Nice.

It does take a bit of work to go from the simple example in the docs...

```python
settings = {'DOMAIN': {'people': {}}}

app = Eve(settings=settings)
app.run()
```

...to a production-ready API, with robust exception handling, logging, control endpoints, configurability, (and so much more).

**eve-utils** helps make some of that work easier.

Install eve-utils with pip.

`pip install eve-utils`

## Getting Started

Get started with three easy steps

1. Create your API (I recommend creating a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) first)

   `mkapi my-api --with_docker`

   *(note: if you don't have docker installed, create the API without `--with-docker`, then later run the API with `python run.py` - assuming you have mongodb running on localhost:27127)*



2. Add domain resources

   ```bash
   cd my-api
   mkresource people
   ```



3. Build and launch the API

   ```bash
   cd ..
   image-build
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   *(note:* `image-build` *is usually called with a version number so the new docker image is correctly tagged - see more in the docs below)*



Try it out with the following curl commands (or use Postman if you prefer)

```bash
curl http://localhost:2112
curl http://localhost:2112/_settings
curl -X POST http://localhost:2112/people -H "Content-type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"Michael\"}"
curl http://localhost:2112/people
```



If you followed the above, be sure to clean up after playing around with your new API:

`docker-compose down`

`docker image rm my-api`



## Commands

* `mkapi` <api-name>

  * creates folder named *api-name*

  * creates a skeleton Eve API in that folder

  * for more details run `mkapi -h`



* `mkresource` <resource-name>

  * adds *resource-name* to the domain

  * default fields are name, description

  * add fields by modifying domain/*resource-name*.py - as you would any Eve resource

  * NOTE: resources in Eve are collections, so eve-utils names resources as plural by convention,

    * i.e. if you enter mkresource **dog** it will create an endpoint named **/dogs**

    * eve-utils rely on the [inflect](https://pypi.org/project/inflect/) library for pluralization, which is very accurate but can make mistakes



* `mkrel` <parent-resource> <child-resource>

  * For example:

    ```bash
    mkresource person
    mkresource cars
    mkrel person car
    ```

    * you could also have typed `mkrel people cars` or `mkrel person cars` - they all are equivalent

  * If you followed the example above, you have already POSTed a person named Michael:

    `curl -X POST http://localhost:2112/people -H "Content-type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"Michael\"}"`

  * Normally GET a person by `_id`.   **eve-utils** wires up the name field as an `additonal_lookup`, so you can also GET by name.

    `curl http://localhost:2112/people/Michael?pretty`

    ```json
    {
      "_id": "606f5453b43a8f480a1b8fc6",
      "name": "Michael",
      "_updated": "2021-04-08T19:06:59",
      "_created": "2021-04-08T19:06:59",
      "_etag": "6e91d500cbb0a2f6645d9b4dced422d429a69820",
      "_links": {
        "self": { "href": "/people/606f5453b43a8f480a1b8fc6", "title": "person" },
        "parent": { "title": "home", "href": "/" },
        "collection": { "title": "people", "href": "people" },
        "cars": { "href": "/people/606f5453b43a8f480a1b8fc6/cars", "title": "cars" }
      }
    }
    ```

  * Notice the `_links` field includes a rel named `cars`.  You can POST a car to that `href` (I'll demonstrate with Javascript):

    ```javascript
    const axios = require('axios')
    axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://localhost:2112'

    axios.get('/people/Michael').then((response) => {
        const person = response.data
        const car = {
            name: 'Mustang'
        }
        axios.post(person._links.cars.href, car)
    })
    ```

  * `-p` `--as_parent_ref`:  field name defaults to `_` *parent-resource* `_ref`, e.g. if the parent name was dogs the field would be `_dog_ref`.  Using this parameter, the field name become literally `_parent_ref`.  Useful to implement generic parent traversals.



* `add_docker` <api-name> - run this in the folder above the root api folder to create basic docker files and some useful build scripts (to be further documented later).

  * NOTE: not necessary if you have created the API using `--with_docker`

  * Adds the following files:

    `Dockerfile`

    `docker-compose.yml` (note: by default this file does not use a volume for mongodb, so killing the container also kills your data)

    `.docker-ignore`

    `image-build`

    `image-build.bat`



* `add_serverless` <api-name> - run this in the folder above the root api folder to create basic serverless files

  * NOTE: not necessary if you have created the API using `--with_serverless`

  * Adds the following files:

    `serverless.py` - instantiates, but doesn't run, the Eve app object.  This object is made available to the serverless framework and is referenced in the `.yml` files

    `serverless-aws.yml`

    `serverless-azure.yml`

    `serverless-google.yml`

    `logging_no-files.yml` - copy this over the original `logging.yml` to eliminate logging to the file system (which is not available with serverless)

  * Also installs serverless globally with npm, does an npm init in the root api folder, and locally installs some serverless plugins (node modules).



*  `add_auth`  - run this in the API folder. It will add a folder named ``auth`` with modules to add authorization to your API (docs to come)
   * NOTE: not necessary if you have created the API using `--with_auth`
   * NOTE: the only supported IdP is [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) at the moment, but it will be fairly easy to manually tweak to use any OAuth2 JWT issuer. (I have used a forked [Glewlwyd](https://github.com/babelouest/glewlwyd) with very minimal changes)


* `add_val` - run this in the API folder.  It will add a folder named `validation` with a module that adds custom validator to `EveService`.  Use this to extend custom validations.  It comes with two:

  * NOTE: not necessary if you have created the API using `--with_val`

  * `unique_ignorecase` - works exactly like the built-in `unique` validator except case is ignored

  * `unique_to_parent` - set this to a string of a resource's parent (singular!).  Uniqueness will only be applied to sibling resources, i.e. the same name can be used if the resource has a different parent.

    * e.g.

      ```bash
      mkresource region
      mkresource store
      mkrel region store
      ```

      Now in domain.store, change the name field definition from this:

      ```python
      'name": {
        'type': 'string',
              ...
        'unique': True
      }
      ```

      to this:

      ```python
      'name": {
        'type': 'string',
              ...
        'unique_to_parent': 'region'
      }
      ```

*  `add_web_socket`  - run this in the API folder. It will add web socket at `{{BASE_API_URL}}/_ws`
   * Define other events/listeners, emitters/senders in `web_socket/__init__.py` - feel free to remove the default stuff you see there
   * There is a test client at `{{BASE_API_URL}}/_ws` (which you can remove in `web_socket/__init__.py` by removing the `/_ws/chat` route)
     * This is useful to see how to configure the Javascript socket.io client to connect to the web socket now running in the API
     * It is also useful to test messages - the chat app merely re-emits what it receives
