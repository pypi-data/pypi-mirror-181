This code uses keyring library to safety store username and password for
any services in the configured keyring. The current code implements
single command line able to add/remove/check entries from the keyring.

On linux ubuntu, the default keyring is gnome app name `seahorse`, but kwallet
is also
   pros:
     - unique and secure password storage solution
     - single interface to store credential
     - multiple backends and alternatives are possible (see doc
        at https://keyring.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
   cons:
     - library API exposes only basic authentication username/password.
       Usage of OAuth2.0/Certificates/ssh key requires some alternatives.
     - The keyring used in backend (ubuntu) is the gnome GUI that requires
       advanced configuration to be used without gui (see Linux headless notes
       here after)

The analysis only identified this library to store passwords.


Linux headless notes
--------------------
When Linux system is run without GUI, the keyring can still be used with dbus.

```shell
dbus-run-session -- sh
echo 'somecredstorepass' | gnome-keyring-daemon --unlock
```

Notes of 02/05/2022:
As far as keyring manage service credentail storage by (service, username)
primary key pair, it is not possible to retrieve username for a service.
The alternative consists in store services information by key has a hash map:
{service=service_name, username=key_name, password=key_info}
where key_name is a fixed string (i.e. 'username', 'password' ...)
  and key value is the value.

This change resolved the limitation of storing OAuth2.0 settings, because the
key/value information stored for one service is not limited.
A dedicated mechanism shall be defined to manage multiple credentials
per service. But this use case is currently not handled by the rest of the
system.

The bad border effect is the external tools are not any more able to
add/remove new service credential for this library.
