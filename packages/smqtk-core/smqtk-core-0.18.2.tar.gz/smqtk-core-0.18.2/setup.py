    'long_description': '# SMQTK - Core\n\nA light-weight, non-intrusive framework for developing interfaces that have\nbuilt-in implementation discovery and factory construction from a simple\nconfiguration structure.\n\nWhile anything may make use of this library, this was originally developed\nas a foundation for a suite of packages that predominantly support **AI** and\n**Machine Learning** use-cases:\n\n* Scalable data structure interfaces and implementations, with a focus on those\n  relevant for machine learning like descriptors, classifications, and object\n  detections.\n\n* Interfaces and implementations of machine learning algorithms with a focus on\n  media-based functionality.\n****\n## Libraries\nSome above-mentioned packages supporting AI/ML topics include the following:\n\n* [SMQTK-Dataprovider] provides\n  abstractions around data storage and retrieval.\n\n* [SMQTK-Image-IO] provides\n  interfaces and implementations around image reading and writing using\n  abstractions defined in [SMQTK-Dataprovider].\n\n* [SMQTK-Descriptors] provides\n  algorithms and data structures around computing descriptor vectors from\n  different kinds of input data.\n\n* [SMQTK-Classifier] provides\n  interfaces and implementations around black-box classification.\n\n* [SMQTK-Detection] provides interfaces and support for black-box object\n  detection.\n\n* [SMQTK-Indexing] provides\n  interfaces and implementations for efficient, large-scale indexing of\n  descriptor vectors.\n  The sources of such descriptor vectors may come from a multitude of sources,\n  such as hours of video archives.\n  Some provided implementation plugins include [Locality-sensitive Hashing\n  (LSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) and FAIR\'s\n  [FAISS] library.\n\n* [SMQTK-Relevancy] provides\n  interfaces and implementations for ranking datasets using human-in-the-loop\n  feedback.\n  This is a primary component for Interactive Query Refinement (IQR) systems\n  that makes use of human feedback.\n\n* [SMQTK-IQR] provides classes and utilities to perform the Interactive Query\n  Refinement (IQR) process. This package also includes a web API exposing the\n  use of these tools as well as an example web UI service to demonstrate the\n  capability. These services are additionally containerized to provide some\n  portability of these services.\n\nThese packages are related as follows:\n\n![Dependency Graph](docs/images/dep_block.svg)\n\n## This looks a lot like KWIVER! Why use this instead?\n[KWIVER] is another open source package that similarly holds modularity,\nplugins and configurability at its core.\n\nThe SMQTK-* suite of functionality exists separately from KWIVER for a few\nreasons (for now):\n* History\n  * The origins of KWIVER and SMQTK were initiated at roughly the same\n    time and were never resolved into the same thing because...\n* Language\n  * KWIVER has historically been predominantly C++ while SMQTK-* is (mostly)\n    pure python. (see note below)\n* Configuration UX\n  * SMQTK takes an "add on" approach to configurability: concrete\n    implementations have parameterized constructors and should be usable after\n    construction like a "normal" object.\n    Configuration semantics are derived from introspection of, and explicitly\n    related to, the constructor.\n    KWIVER takes an alternative approach where construction is generally empty\n    and configuration setting is a required separate step via a custom object\n    (`ConfigBlock`).\n* Pythonic Plugin Support\n  * Plugins are exposed via standard package entrypoints.\n\n> If I\'m using python, does that mean that SMQTK is __*always*__ the better\n> choice?\n\nAt this point, not necessarily.\nWhile this used to be true for a number of years due to SMQTK being the toolkit\nwith python support.\nThis is becoming more blurry KWIVER\'s continuously improving python binding\nsupport.\n\n## Building Documentation\nDocumentation is [hosted on ReadTheDocs.io here](\nhttps://smqtk-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n\nYou can also build the sphinx documentation locally for the most up-to-date\nreference:\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\npoetry install\n# Navigate to the documentation root.\ncd docs\n# Build the docs.\npoetry run make html\n# Open in your favorite browser!\nfirefox _build/html/index.html\n```\n\n\n[FAISS]: https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss\n[KWIVER]: https://github.com/kitware/kwiver\n[SMQTK-Dataprovider]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Dataprovider\n[SMQTK-Image-IO]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Image-IO\n[SMQTK-Descriptors]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Descriptors\n[SMQTK-Classifier]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Classifier\n[SMQTK-Detection]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Detection\n[SMQTK-Indexing]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Indexing\n[SMQTK-Relevancy]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-Relevancy\n[SMQTK-IQR]: https://github.com/Kitware/SMQTK-IQR\n',
