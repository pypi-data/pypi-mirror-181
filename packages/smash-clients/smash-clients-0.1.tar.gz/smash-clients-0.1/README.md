# SMASH client

Local Python clients for Smash.  And maybe a library you can use with them or
something, idk.

## SMASH xbar

The SMASH xbar client works with [xbar](https://xbarapp.com/) to provide
near-realtime information on node and service status in your Mac menu bar.
(xbar is a fantastic app--I use it for several things).
