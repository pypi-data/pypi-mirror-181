## DesyRDL

This tool generates outputs for an address space that is defined by one or many
SystemRDL&trade; 2.0 input files. The address space could be made up of all the
software-accessible registers and memory regions in an FPGA design, or just the
registers of a single IP block.

SystemRDL&trade; 2.0 is a standard released by Accellera Systems Initiative Inc
that is meant to describe such an address space, see [\[systemrdl\]](#systemrdl).

Outputs are based on templates. Writing your own should be easy. Provided with
this package are templates and common files for the following outputs:

* Synthesizable VHDL register logic
* Mapfiles (format used internally at DESY MSK)
* C header files
* AsciiDoc documentation

DesyRDL was developed at [DESY](https://desy.de) in the MSK firmware group as a
replacement for its existing proprietary method of register and address map
generation, the "Internal Interface", called "IBUS" in its latest version
[ii](#ii).

The idea to use the SystemRDL&trade; 2.0 standard came from
[MicroTCA Tech Lab](https://techlab.desy.de/) at DESY when they wrote
[HECTARE](https://github.com/MicroTCA-Tech-Lab/hectare), the predecessor of
DesyRDL.

## Usage

This tool can be used standalone but was intended to be used as part of a
firmware build environment like DESY MSK's
[FPGA Firmware Framework](https://fpgafw.pages.desy.de/docs-pub/fwk/index.html),
short `fwk`.

See `desyrdl -h` for options.
All RDL files must be passed in the correct order. Below is an example for the
`test_hectare` module which also comes with a testbench (not in Git yet):

    desyrdl -o out -i examples/spi_ad9510.rdl examples/test_hectare.rdl -f vhdl

This will compile the `.rdl` file and create one `.vhd` in `./out/` for each
`addrmap` instance in the model and for each VHDL template in
`./desyrdl/templates/vhdl/`. The common files from `./desyrdl/libraries/vhdl/`
will also be copied there.

The generated VHDL logic should be integrated into your module or IP as an
entity next to the other logic. This is shown in the diagram below. Registers
and external interfaces are available on combined ports of a custom record type
(e.g. `t_addrmap_mymodule_in` and `t_addrmap_mymodule_out`). Through these
records, each node in this `addrmap` can be accessed by its SystemRDL instance
name. Check the generated VHDL package for details.

## Concept

Compiling the SystemRDL&trade; files is handled by
[SystemRDL Compiler](https://systemrdl-compiler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
To create useful information (or "context") for the template processing, its
Walker/Listener method of traversing the compiled tree is used.

`DesyListener` extends its `systemrdl.RDLListener` class. It extracts a fixed
set of information from the compiled tree and passes it on to a custom template
engine (`RdlFormatter`).

### Templates

The custom template engine is inspired by
https://github.com/ebrehault/superformatter. Everything within curly braces {}
is interpreted as a "replacement field" and replaced by the output of the
formatter. This is inherited from Python's `Formatter` class, so its behavior
is very similar to a formatted print in Python. In addition to that it can also
perform advanced actions, e.g. loop over all registers within an addrmap. For
all this it relies on "context" which holds all the necessary information about
the address space.

### Context

Context creation differs a bit depending on the type of output. Some outputs
have to be generated for each `addrmap` component (e.g. VHDL) and others are
generated for the whole address space at once (e.g. mapfiles and the C header).

The context is a Python `dict` that contains further dictionaries to describe
register types and instances, memory types and instances, further external
components and some more. It is currently a bit of a mess.

## Known Issues and Limitations

The bus decoder implementation is relatively basic:

* Only AXI4-Lite with 32 bit data width is supported as the upstream interface
* Likewise, only 32 bit registers are supported
* The dual-port memory interface does not support AXI4 write strobes
* Timing issues can arise when having a large number of registers per addrmap.
  A review is needed here.
* The logic operates on a single clock and the developer has to take care of any
  CDCs
