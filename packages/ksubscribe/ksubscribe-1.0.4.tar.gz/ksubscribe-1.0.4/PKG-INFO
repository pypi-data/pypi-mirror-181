Python-Event-Based-Programming-Methodology

<br/><br/>
This is a library that help python coder to run event-based methodology.
<br/><br/>
You can subscribe an event from object to another object. Ksubscribe library is designed with _**Singleton design pattern**_. So, if you create more that one Ksubscribe object, the all object is actually **same object**.
<br/><br/>!!!!<br/>
Subscriber class must have inform functions. You can see the examples in examples.

You can publish the event from subscriber like this <br/>
```
    self.slaveEventObject = Ksubscribe()
    def eventTwoSecond(self):
        self.slaveEventObject._publish(eventName="everyTwoSecond")
```

The ksubscribe library has these function that is mentioned in below.

````
    def _subscribeForAnEvent(self,subscriber,eventName:str)

    def _createAnEvent(self, eventName:str)

    def _publish(self,eventName:str,parameters=None)

    def _removeAnEvent(self,eventName:str)

    def _removeAllEvents(self):
    
```
