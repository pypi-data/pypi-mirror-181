Ksubscribe library for Python Coders

<br/><br/>
This is a library that help python coder to run event-based methodology.
<br/><br/>
You can subscribe an event from object to another object. Ksubscribe library is designed with _**Singleton design pattern**_. So, if you create more that one Ksubscribe object, the all object is actually **same object**.
<br/><br/>

## **!!!!**

<br/>

Firstly, subscriber can subscribe an any event that is created before.  After this operation, subscriber class **must have inform functions**. 

You can see the inform function in below. Subscribed classc can send only one parameter that can be list, dict etc.

```
    def inform(self,eventName,parameters=None)

```

You can publish the event from subscriber like this from **subscribed class** <br/>

```
    self.slaveEventObject = Ksubscribe()
    def eventTwoSecond(self):
        self.slaveEventObject._publish(eventName="everyTwoSecond")
```

The ksubscribe library has these function that is mentioned in below.

```
    def _subscribeForAnEvent(self,subscriber,eventName:str)

    def _createAnEvent(self, eventName:str)

    def _publish(self,eventName:str,parameters=None)

    def _removeAnEvent(self,eventName:str)

    def _removeAllEvents(self):
    
```
