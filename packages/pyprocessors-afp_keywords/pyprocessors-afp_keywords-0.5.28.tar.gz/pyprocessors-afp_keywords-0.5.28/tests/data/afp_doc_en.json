    "text": "Japan to restart football without spectators on July 4\n\nProfessional football games in Japan will resume in early July without spectators in stadiums after a four-month suspension due to the coronavirus outbreak, the J-League said Friday.\n\n\n\"We have decided to resume games on July 4\" for the first division, league chairman Mitsuru Murai announced online.\n\n\n\"Making a start on July 4 means it is too early to invite spectators,\" he said. Lower divisions will resume games in late June.\n\n\nFootball is the second major professional sport in Japan to announce a return to action after a break forced by the pandemic, following the baseball league's announcement it would return to play in June.\n\n\nJ-League first-division Cerezo Osaka player Yoichiro Kakitani said \"worries have not been completely cleared... but it will be best that all teams in the J-League work together and face off with mutual respect.\"\n\n\nThe J-League kicked off the season for one weekend in February before suspending it.\n\n\nFollowing the government announcement on Monday that it will lift a nationwide state of emergency, Japan's professional baseball league announced it would start its coronavirus-delayed season on June 19 but without spectators.\n\n\nThe virus has killed hundreds of thousands, infected millions and decimated the annual sporting calendar internationally.\n\n\nIt forced a one-year delay of the summer Tokyo Olympics, and suspended everything from in Japan from sumo to the summer high-school baseball tournament -- an enormously popular event that annually receives wall-to-wall live television coverage.\n\n\nmis/sah/gle",

    "text": "Famed Paris store Galeries Lafayette to reopen\n\nParis's famed Galeries Lafayette department store, which receives some 37 million visitors every year -- many of them tourists -- will reopen this weekend after being shuttered for nearly three months by the coronavirus pandemic, it said Friday.\n\n\nClosed along with most other retailers since mid-March, the massive store on Boulevard Haussmann in central Paris will throw its doors open from 11:00 am Saturday.\n\n\nFrance started emerging from two-months of lockdown on May 11, although the larger Paris region remains in an \"orange\" zone of high coronavirus vigilance and has been slower to return to business as usual.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 epidemic has killed over 28,000 people in France, the world's fourth-highest reported toll.\n\n\nInaugurated in 1912, the Galeries Lafayette Haussmann claims on its website to be Europe's biggest retailer in terms of sales, with nearly 40 million clients annually.\n\n\nEven as the lockdown was partially lifted in France, shops with more than 40,000 square metres (430,000 square feet) of floor space were forbidden to open before July 10 due to the continued threat posed by the virus.\n\n\nThis was challenged by Galeries Lafayette and rival luxury store Printemps, which reopened Thursday after a favourable court ruling.\n\n\nIn the case of Galeries Lafayette, permission came from the police department in Paris.\n\n\nThe store said it would require strict observation of sanitary rules, including obligatory face masks for clients and staff, and will limit the number of people who can enter at one time.\n\n\nIt will take some time for sales numbers to return to pre-coronavirus levels, given the lack of foreign shoppers as international travel remains largely shut down.\n\n\nlrb/mlr/bmm",
