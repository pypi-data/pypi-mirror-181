Re-implementation of the [Supernova orbit propagator](https://github.com/utat-ss/supernova) in a faster and more accessible package.

Hypernova is a fast orbit propagator implemented in C and wrapped for Python, designed for the University of Toronto Aerospace Team's FINCH mission. FINCH orbits in a 550 km Sun-Synchronous orbit, and as such the solvers and physics models used by Hypernova were selected for the best simulation fidelity in a low-Earth orbit.

# Installation
## From PyPI (recommended)
Hypernova is on PyPI as [`hypernova-orbit`](https://pypi.org/project/hypernova-orbit/). Install using the following command:

`pip install hypernova-orbit`

**Note that a C compiler is required on your system in order for the C backend to be built.**

## From GitHub
You can install Hypernova from source as a Python package using the following command:

`pip install git+https://github.com/utat-ss/hypernova`

This will let you get the most cutting-edge builds of Hypernova before they're pushed to PyPI.

# Compatibility
Hypernova uses `cffi` to wrap a fast C backend into easier-to-access functions in Python. The C backend does not come pre-compiled, and instead requires a compiler on the system to compile modules at install time. Hypernova is designed to automate this process, and it has been tested on the following operating systems:
* Windows 10 (x86)
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (x86)
* MacOS 12 (M1)

If you have issues installing Hypernova on your computer, [please open an issue](https://github.com/utat-ss/hypernova/issues/new/)!

# Demos
Hypernova comes with a few examples which you can run.
## Basic Orbit and Plot
`python -m hypernova.examples.basic_orbit_and_plot`

This will generate the following output:

# Testing Suite
Hypernova is equipped with a testing suite to validate its functionality. The way to run the testing suite is to copy the scripts from the `/tests` folder into your working path and run `pytest` from your command terminal.
