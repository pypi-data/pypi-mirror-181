# All variables intended for modification should be placed in this file.

# All variables within this role should have a prefix of "tripleo_container_tag"

# NOTE(cloudnull): This role used to use a non-namespaced option, which has a high
#                  probability of creating conflicts with other roles in the greater
#                  ansible ecosystem. To ensure that we're able to retain existing
#                  variable functionality the "modules" option will supersede
#                  "tripleo_modules" if defined. This default should be removed
#                  just as soon as we're validate that the non-namespaced option
#                  is no longer in use.
#
# Set the container command line entry-point
tripleo_container_cli: "{{ container_cli | default('podman') }}"

# Enable or disable pulling images.
tripleo_container_pull_image: "{{ pull_image | default(true) }}"

# Name of the tag
tripleo_container_image_latest: "{{ container_image_latest | default('latest') }}"

# Set the default container image if undefined
tripleo_container_image: "{{ container_image | default('') }}"
