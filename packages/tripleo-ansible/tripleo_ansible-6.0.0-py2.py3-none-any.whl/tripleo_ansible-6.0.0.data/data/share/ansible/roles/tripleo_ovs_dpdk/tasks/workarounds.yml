# Workaround to allow access of vhostuser sockets from OvS running host to qemu
# running inside the kolla container. GID of the group 'hugetlbfs' is changed
# to the same value as kolla's gid. Apply this workaround for all DPDK nodes,
# along with reboot, so that OvS threads are restarted with this id.
# NOTE: This will not be included in this roles's main.yml, as main.yml should
# be executed after node reboot.
- name: Update gid for hugetlbfs to kolla's gid
  group:
    name: hugetlbfs
