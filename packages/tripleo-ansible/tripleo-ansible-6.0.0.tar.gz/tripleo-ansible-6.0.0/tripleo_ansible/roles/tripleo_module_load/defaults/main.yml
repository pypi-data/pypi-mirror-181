# All variables intended for modification should be placed in this file.

# Load specific kernel modules using a list of hashes. This variable also
# takes the keyword "params" and "state". Params is assumed to be `null` and
# state is assumed to be "present"; tate can be either "present" or "absent".
#
# modules:
#   - name: foo
#     params: 'bar baz'
#   - name: starwars
#   - name: starwars
#     state: absent
#
# NOTE(cloudnull): This role used to use a non-namespaced option, which has a high
#                  probability of creating conflicts with other roles in the greater
#                  ansible ecosystem. To ensure that we're able to retain existing
#                  variable functionality the "modules" option will supersede
#                  "tripleo_modules" if defined. This default should be removed
#                  just as soon as we're validate that the non-namespaced option
#                  is no longer in use.
