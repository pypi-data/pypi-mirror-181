    Deployment failure was observed when repository files are present, but the
    ctlplane is a non routed network. The node cannot connect to repositories
    before the network is configured in this case. Some roles use the ansible
    built-in ``package`` which fail despite the fact that the packages are
    already installed in case it cannot connect to repositories.

    The roles tripleo-bootstrap and tuned will now inspect the installed
    packages to check wheater or not packages are already installed. When
    packages are installed, the ``package`` tasks are skipped. See bug:
    `1959731 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1959731>`_.
