    The tripleo-ssh-known-hosts ansible role used the list of network names to
    create the different possible hostnames in the ssh_known_hosts file. The
    network names do not match the actual network hostnames, like internal_api
    vs. internalapi which results in ssh host verification to fail and e.g.
    live migration to fail.

    Initial approach in a5bcbc8d015b792b3546ecbb139506f248dacfe8 had to be
    reverted as it resulted in errors when the _hostname inventory information
    was missing from the ansible inventory.

    This syncs to use the same approach to create the hostname like in
    https://review.opendev.org/693010 to have entries in /etc/hosts and
    ssh_known_hosts created in the same way/source.
