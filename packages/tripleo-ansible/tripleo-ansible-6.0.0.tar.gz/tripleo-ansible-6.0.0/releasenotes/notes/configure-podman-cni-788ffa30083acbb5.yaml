    A new variable named `tripleo_podman_default_network_config` has been added
    to be able to configure the default network used by podman. By default the
    configuration will use `10.255.255.0/24` as a network for podman managed
    containers. TripleO does not use podman's networking, however removing
    this configuration (or making it invalid) breaks the `podman network`
    functions. The network is not applied if it's already running which is
    indicated by the existance of a cni-podman0 interface.
