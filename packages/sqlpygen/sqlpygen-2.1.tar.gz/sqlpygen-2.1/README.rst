SqlPyGen: Generate Type Annotated Python from Annotated SQL
===========================================================

sqlpygen is a utility to generate
type annotated Python code from annotated SQL.
This is in part motivated by sqlc_ project.

The current version of the tool only supports
generating code for SQLite3.

Installation
------------

You can install SqlPyGen using pip.

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install sqlpygen

Example Usage
-------------

When using sqlpygen to generate Python code from SQL,
one creates an annotated SQL file.

.. code:: sql

  # example1.sql
  # This is an example of annotated sql file.

  # Lines starting with # are ignored by SqlPyGen.
  # Lines starting with -- are used to provide SqlPyGen with annotations.

  # Using the "module" annotation
  # we name the python module to be generated.
  -- module: example1

  # We use "schema" annotations to annotate
  # create table and create index sql statements.
  # The statements are given a name which is used in the generated code
  # to produce better error messages.
  # Each SQL statement must end with a semicolon.
  -- schema: table_stocks

  CREATE TABLE stocks (
      date text,
      trans text,
      symbol text,
      qty real,
      price real
  ) ;

  # Here we annotate a query.
  # The name of the query is used as the name of the function that is generated.
  # The query parameters are named and annotated with types.
  # The names can then be used in the query.
  # Since this query doesn't specify a return annotation,
  # SqlPyGen assumes that this SQL statement doesn't return anything.
  # The types here are builtin Python types.
  # By marking types ! at their end, we inform SqlPyGen,
  # that the specific parameter may never by None.
  -- query: insert_into_stocks
  -- params: date: str!, trans: str!, symbol: str!, qty: float, price: float

  INSERT INTO stocks VALUES (:date, :trans, :symbol, :qty, :price) ;

  # Here we annotate a query with no parameters
  # but one that returns some columns.
  # Based the name of the query, and the return annotation
  # SqlPyGen will generate a Python dataclass of appropriate type.
  # The "return*" annotation tells SqlPyGen that this query may return
  # zero or more rows.
  # The following query is annotated with "return?",
  # tells SqlPyGen that it will return zero or exactly one row.
  -- query: select_from_stocks
  -- return*: date: str, trans: str, symbol: str, qty: float, price: float

  SELECT * FROM stocks ;

  -- query: count_stocks
  -- return?: count: int!

  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stocks ;


Copy and save the above file as ``example1.py``.

Next use the following command to generate the python code.

.. code:: bash

   $ sqlpygen -i example1.sql -o example1.py -d sqlite3

To check the syntax of the sql statements are correct
one can execute the generated python file.

.. code:: bash

  $ python example1.py
  Query insert_into_stocks is syntactically valid.
  Query select_from_stocks is syntactically valid.
  Query count_stocks is syntactically valid.
