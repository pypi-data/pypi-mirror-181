# tsml-eval

Evaluation tools for classification, regression and clustering algorithms built on the sktime interface.

Dependency installation
-----------------------

pip install -r requirements.txt

Export package versions to new requirements
-------------------------------------------

pip freeze > requirements.txt


sktime install from main, branch or fork
