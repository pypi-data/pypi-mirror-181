    """Closest to Average - chooses the output with the embedding closest to the average embedding.

    This method takes a `DataFrame` containing four columns: `task`, `worker`, `output`, and `embedding`.
    Here the `embedding` is a vector containing a representation of the `output`. The `output` might be any
    type of data such as text, images, NumPy arrays, etc. As the result, the method returns the output which
    embedding is the closest one to the average embedding of the task's responses.

    Args:
        distance: A callable that takes two NumPy arrays and returns a single `float` number â€” the distance
            between these two vectors.

    Attributes:
        embeddings_and_outputs_ (DataFrame): Tasks' embeddings and outputs.
            A pandas.DataFrame indexed by `task` with `embedding` and `output` columns.

            A pandas.DataFrame indexed by `task` such that `result.loc[task, label]`
            is the score of `label` for `task`.
