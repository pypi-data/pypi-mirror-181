Frequently asked questions
==========================


What's this and why should I care?
----------------------------------

**Raider** was developed with the goal to improve web
:term:`authentication` testing. It feels like everyone is writing
their own custom tools which work only on their own system, and this
project aims to fill that gap by becoming a universal authentication
testing framework that works on all modern systems.

How does it work?
-----------------

**Raider** treats the :term:`authentication` process as a
:term:`finite state machine`. Each authentication step has to be
configured separately, together with all pieces of information needed
and how to extract them.

**Raider** uses a configuration directory containing a set of ``.hy``
files for each new project. Those files contain information describing
the authentication process. **Raider** evaluates them, and gives you
back a Python object to interact with the application.

.. _faq_eval:

You're telling me it'll evaluate all user input? Isn't that unsafe?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, by making the decision to run real code inside configuration
files I made it possible to run malicious code. Which is why you
should **always write your own configuration**, and not copy it from
untrusted sources. **Raider** assumes you are acting like a
responsible adult if you're using this project. If the user wants to
write an Operation that will ``rm -rf`` something on their machine
when a HTTP response is received, who am I to judge? With that said, I
don't take any responsibility if using **Raider** makes your computer
catch fire, your company bankrupt, starts the third world war, leads
to AI taking over humanity, or anything else in between.



How do I run this?
------------------

A CLI is planned to be done soon. For now, you can only run it by
writing a short Python script:

.. code-block:: python

   import raider
   
   session = raider.Raider("app_name")
   # Create a Raider() object for application "app_name"
   
   session.config.proxy = "http://localhost:8080"
   # Run traffic through the local web proxy

   session.authenticate()
   # Run authentication stages one by one
   
   session.run_function("get_nickname")
   # Run the defined "get_nickname" function



Do I need to know Python and Hylang in order to use **Raider**?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, **Raider** documentation already assumes you know the basic
concepts in both Python and Hylang. You don't have to know a lot. If
it's your first time with Python, just get yourself familiar with it,
and when you're ready move on to learning Hylang, which is basically
just Python code surrounded by Lisp parentheses.


.. _why_lisp:

Why Lisp?
---------

Because in Lisp, code is data, and data is code. First iterations
through planning this project were done with a static configuration
file, experimenting with different formats. However, it turns out all
of those static formats had problems. They can't easily execute code,
they can't hold data structures, etc... Changing this to a Lisp file,
all those problems vanished away, and it gives the user the power to
add features easily without messing with the main code.



Why is Raider using Hylang?
---------------------------

Because the main code is written in Python. After deciding to choose
Lisp for the new configuration format, I obviously googled "python
lisp", and found this project. Looking through the documentation
I realized it turns out to be the perfect fit for my needs.




Does it work on Windows?
------------------------

Probably not. I don't have enough time to test it on other platforms.


What about macOS? BSD? etc?
---------------------------

I didn't test it, but should probably work as long as it's unix-like.


How can I contribute?
---------------------

If you're interested in contributing, you can do so. After you managed
to set up your first application, figure out what could have been made
easier or better.

Then start writing new Plugins and Operations and share them either on
`Github`_ or `privately with me`_.

Once you're familiar with the structure of the project, you can start
by fixing bugs and writing new features.
