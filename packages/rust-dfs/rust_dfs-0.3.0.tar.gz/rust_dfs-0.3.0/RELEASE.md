## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-30
### Other
- adding action to deploy docs
### Rust
- removed `input_set` in favor of `column_schema`(#5)
- created a hashmap that keys by both logical_type and semantic_tag and then finds set interception between them for matching features to a primitive (#5)
- primitive types that can't be found are tagged as "Any". So a Primitive that has an input of ["", "Numeric"], can match to a feature that has any logical_type and a semantic tag of Numeric. (#5)
- removed a lot of references in place of `.clone()`. This will need to be revisited. (#5)
- created directory for feature related code (#5)
