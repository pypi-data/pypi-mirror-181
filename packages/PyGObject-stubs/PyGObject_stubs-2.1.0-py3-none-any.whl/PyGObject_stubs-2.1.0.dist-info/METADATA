## Installation
```
pip install PyGObject-stubs
```

### Installation of Multi Version stubs

Some libraries exist in multiple versions like Gtk3/4. As both libraries are
currently imported under the namespace `Gtk` only stubs for one can be installed.

You need to decide this at install time with setting the ENV var
`PYGOBJECT_STUB_CONFIG`.

Example:
`PYGOBJECT_STUB_CONFIG=Gtk4,Soup3 pip install .`
