========================
pycloudmessenger
========================

The purpose of this project is to provide sample code for interacting with various messaging based cloud platforms provided by IBM Research Europe - Dublin.


Prerequisites
---------------------------------

It is assumed that all development takes place in Python, using at least version 3.6.


Testing
---------------------------------

Unit tests are contained in the `tests <tests>`_ directory.

To run the unit tests, a local RabbitMQ container is launched automatically. Settings and credentials to match the latest RabbitMQ docker image are also provided. To run the test:

.. code-block:: bash

	creds=local.json make test 


Examples
---------------------------------

Sample code for basic messaging as well as federated learning and castor are contained in the `examples <examples>`_ directory. To run various samples, invoke the appropriate make target, as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

	# The basic messaging sample
	creds=local.json make basic

.. code-block:: bash

	# The federated learning sample (online, requires cloud credentials)

	python -m examples.ffl.register --credentials=<CLOUDCREDENTIALS> --user=<USER> --password=<PASSWORD> > credentials.json
	python -m examples.ffl.sample --credentials=credentials.json
	python -m examples.ffl.deregister --credentials=credentials.json

.. code-block:: bash

	# The castor sample
	creds=credentials.json make castor

**Note:** For online platforms, **<CLOUDCREDENTIALS>** must be available. Please request from the IBM team.
