# Subsystems

This is a demo for creating a scheduler with an API.
We use [Rocketry](https://rocketry.readthedocs.io/)
for our scheduler and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
for our API.

This contains three source files:

- ``app/api.py``: FastAPI application
- ``app/scheduler.py``: Rocketry application
- ``app/main.py``: Main launch script

Add your tasks need to ``app/scheduler/tasks/`` and 
modify API routes in ``app/api/routes/`` as needed.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Miksus/rocketry-with-fastapi.git
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or newer.
Then just install the dependencies:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```console
python -m app
```

## Front-end

For the front-end, download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com).
Then change to frontend directory to install the Node modules:

```npm
yarn install
```

Then start the server:

```npm
yarn start
```
