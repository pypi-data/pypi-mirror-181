class ConvexSupportFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`ConvexSupportFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing interpolation constraints for the class of closed convex support functions.

    Attributes:
        M (float): upper bound on the Lipschitz constant

    Convex support functions are characterized by a parameter `M`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import ConvexSupportFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=ConvexSupportFunction, M=1)
