class ConvexIndicatorFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`ConvexIndicatorFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing interpolation constraints for the class of closed convex indicator functions.

    Attributes:
        D (float): upper bound on the diameter of the feasible set, possibly set to np.inf

    Convex indicator functions are characterized by a parameter `D`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import ConvexIndicatorFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=ConvexIndicatorFunction, D=1)
