class ConvexLipschitzFunction(Function):
    """
    The :class:`ConvexLipschitzFunction` class overwrites the `add_class_constraints` method of :class:`Function`,
    implementing the interpolation constraints of the class of convex closed proper (CCP) Lipschitz continuous functions.

    Attributes:
        M (float): Lipschitz parameter

    CCP Lipschitz continuous functions are characterized by a parameter `M`, hence can be instantiated as

    Example:
        >>> from PEPit import PEP
        >>> from PEPit.functions import ConvexLipschitzFunction
        >>> problem = PEP()
        >>> func = problem.declare_function(function_class=ConvexLipschitzFunction, M=1.)
