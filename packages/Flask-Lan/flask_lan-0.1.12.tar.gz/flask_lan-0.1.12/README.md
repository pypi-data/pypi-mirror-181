Flask-Lan is kind of like the famous library [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), bringing part of its brilliant features to your Flask application, you can see a lot of similarities between the two.

For example, it uses [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) for request and response validation,
it will auto-generate `OpenAPI` API docs and so on.

## Feature

-   Intuitive and easy to use.
-   Request/Response validation based on type hinting(by Pydantic).
-   Auto-generated `OpenAPI` docs(both swagger and redoc).
-   Designed for API development.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install Flask-Lan
```

You can view and run the code in the [example](/example/) file.
Then open [http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs) you will see the API docs like this:
