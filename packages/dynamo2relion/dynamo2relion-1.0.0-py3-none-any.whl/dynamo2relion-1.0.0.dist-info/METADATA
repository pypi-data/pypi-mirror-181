# Dynamo2Relion
## A Tiny Function to Convert Dynamo Tables to Star Files for RELION 4.0

[![PyPI pyversions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/dynamo2m.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dynamo2m/)

Based on [dynamo2m](https://github.com/alisterburt/dynamo2m) by Alister Burt.

## Installation

Installation is carried out via:
```sh
pip install dynamo2relion
```

## Requirements

Your directory containing the tilt series directories must be structured as follows:

```sh
tilt_series_directory #Directory containing all TS directories, link to this directory
|
--> TS_01 #Directory containing TS_01              
       |
       --> TS_01.mrc #TS_01  image stack. The file extension does not matter.        
|
--> TS_02              
       |
       -->TS_02.mrc  #
|
--> etc...
```

The program will ask you the path to tilt_series_directory. No directories other than the TS_* directories should be present in tilt_series_directory. Naming convention for the TS_* directories can be any mix of upper of lower case TS and any numbering convention desired. 

## Usage

Instructions for use can be found via typing:
```sh
dynamo2relion --help
```

For binning level, simply enter 1 if the coordinates of your particles in the Dynamo table were picked from an unbinned tomogram. If the tomograms the particles were picked in were binned, add the correct binning level: binning is done using IMOD convention, i.e. for a pixel size of 1 A/px, a binning level of 8 would yield 8 A/px.
