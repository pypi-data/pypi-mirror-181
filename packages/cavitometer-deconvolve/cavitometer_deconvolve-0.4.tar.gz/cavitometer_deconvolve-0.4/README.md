Cavitometer Deconvolve is a small library that converts hydrophone voltages into pressures using frequency dependent
sensitivity values. The library also supports voltage corrections due to pre-amplifiers.

## Installation
```bash
pip install cavitometer-deconvolve
```

## Usage
See [the documentation example page](https://blebon.com/cavitometer-deconvolve/examples.html) 
for usage examples.
