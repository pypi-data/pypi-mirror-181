# The Data Manager Package

The ``dman`` package is intended for enabling easy reproducibility of numerical experiments. Data is stored in a human-readable fashion (whenever possible).

[Documentation](https://petercoppens.github.io/dman/docs/index.html) is provided in Sphinx. 
A good place to start is the [Getting Started](https://petercoppens.github.io/dman/docs/gallery/misc/example0_common.html) page.

Documented [Examples](https://petercoppens.github.io/dman/docs/gallery/fundamentals/index.html) are also provided. Especially check out those 
in [Patterns](https://petercoppens.github.io/dman/docs/gallery/patterns/index.html) for common use-cases
and [Case Studies](https://petercoppens.github.io/dman/docs/gallery/cases/index.html) for examples on how to interface 
``dman`` with other common packages like ``numpy``.
