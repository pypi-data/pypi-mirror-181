*Disclaimer: The author is NOT a cryptographer and this work has not been reviewed. This means that there is very likely a fatal flaw somewhere. Cashu is still experimental and not production-ready.*

Cashu is an Ecash implementation based on David Wagner's variant of Chaumian blinding. Token logic based on [minicash](https://github.com/phyro/minicash) ([description](https://gist.github.com/phyro/935badc682057f418842c72961cf096c)) which implements a [Blind Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange](https://cypherpunks.venona.com/date/1996/03/msg01848.html) scheme written down by Ruben Somsen [here](https://gist.github.com/RubenSomsen/be7a4760dd4596d06963d67baf140406). The database mechanics and the Lightning backend uses parts from [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend).

## Cashu client protocol
There are ongoing efforts to implement alternative Cashu clients that use the same protocol such as a [Cashu Javascript wallet](https://github.com/motorina0/cashu-js-wallet). If you are interested in helping with Cashu development, please see the [docs](docs/) for the notation and conventions used. 

## Easy Install

The easiest way to use Cashu is to install the package it via pip:
```bash
pip install cashu
```

To update Cashu, use `pip install cashu -U`. 

If you have problems running the command above on Ubuntu, run `sudo apt install -y pip pkg-config`. On macOS, you might have to run `pip install wheel` and `brew install pkg-config`.

You can skip the entire next section about Poetry and jump right to [Using Cashu](#using-cashu).

## Hard install: Poetry
These steps help you install Python via pyenv and Poetry. If you already have Poetry running on your computer, you can skip this step and jump right to [Install Cashu](#poetry-install-cashu).

#### Poetry: Prerequisites

```bash
# on ubuntu:
sudo apt install -y build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libpq-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev python3-dev libsqlite3-dev
# on mac: brew install postgres

# install python using pyenv
curl https://pyenv.run | bash

# !! follow the instructions of pyenv init to setup pyenv !!
pyenv init

# restart your shell (or source your .rc file), then install python:
pyenv install 3.9.13

# install poetry
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
echo export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
#### Poetry: Install Cashu
```bash
# install cashu
git clone https://github.com/callebtc/cashu.git
cd cashu
pyenv local 3.9.13
poetry install
```

#### Poetry: Update Cashu
To update Cashu to the newest version enter
```bash
git pull && poetry install
```
#### Poetry: Using Cashu

Cashu should be now installed. To execute the following commands, activate your virtual Poetry environment via

```bash
poetry shell
```

If you don't activate your environment, just prepend `poetry run` to all following commands.
## Configuration
```bash
mv .env.example .env
# edit .env file
vim .env
```

To use the wallet with the [public test mint](#test-instance), you need to change the appropriate entries in the `.env` file. 

#### Test instance
*Warning: this instance is just for demonstration only. The server could vanish at any moment so consider any Satoshis you deposit a donation.*

Change the appropriate `.env` file settings to
```bash
MINT_HOST=8333.space
MINT_PORT=3338
```

# Using Cashu
```bash
cashu info
```

Returns:
```bash
Version: 0.6.0
Debug: False
Cashu dir: /home/user/.cashu
Wallet: wallet
Mint URL: https://8333.space:3338
```

#### Get Cashu info
```bash
cashu balance
```

#### Check balance
```bash
cashu balance
```
#### Generate a Lightning invoice 

This command will return a Lightning invoice that you need to pay to mint new ecash tokens.

```bash
cashu invoice 420
```
Returns:
```bash
Pay this invoice to mint 420 sat:
Invoice: lnbc4200n1p3nfk7zsp522g8wlsx9cvmhtyuyuae48nvreew9x9f8kkqhd2v2umrdtwl2ysspp5w2w6jvcnz4ftcwsxtad5kv3yev62pcp5cvq42dqqrmwtr2k6mk8qdq4vdshx6r4ypjx2ur0wd5hgxqyjw5qcqpjrzjqfe5jlwxmwt4sa4s8mqjqp8qtreqant6mqwwkts46dtawvncjwvhczurxgqqvvgqqqqqqqqnqqqqqzgqyg9qyysgqzaus4lsfs3zzk4ehdzrkxzv8ryu2yxppxyjrune3nks2dgrnua6nv7lsztmyjaf96xp569tf7rxdmfud5q45zmr4xue5hjple6xhcrcpfmveag

Execute this command if you abort the check:
cashu invoice 420 --hash 729da933131552bc3a065f5b4b3224cb34a0e034c3015534001edcb1aadadd8e

Checking invoice ...
```

The client will check every few seconds if the invoice has been paid. If you abort this step but still pay the invoice, you can use the command `cashu invoice <amount> --hash <hash>` as described above.

#### Pay a Lightning invoice
```bash
cashu pay lnbc120n1p3jfmdapp5r9jz...
```
Returns:
```bash
Balance: 351 sat (Available: 351 sat in 7 tokens)
Balance: 339 sat (Available: 339 sat in 8 tokens)
```

#### Send tokens
To send tokens to another user, enter
```bash
cashu send 69
```
You should see the encoded token. Copy the token and send it to another user such as via email or a messenger. The token looks like this:
```bash
W3siYW1vdW50IjogMSwgIkMiOiB7IngiOiAzMzg0Mzg0NDYzNzAwMTY1NDA2MTQxMDY3Mzg1MDg5MjA2MTU2NjQxMjM4Nzg5MDE4NzAzODg0NjAwNDUzNTAwNzY3...
```

You can now see that your available balance has dropped by the amount that you reserved for sending if you enter `cashu balance`:
```bash
Balance: 420 sat (Available: 351 sat in 7 tokens)
```

#### Receive tokens
To receive tokens, another user enters:
```bash
cashu receive W3siYW1vdW50IjogMSwgIkMiOi...
```
You should see the balance increase:
```bash
Balance: 0 sat (Available: 0 sat in 0 tokens)
Balance: 69 sat (Available: 69 sat in 3 tokens)
```

#### Burn tokens
The sending user needs to burn (invalidate) their tokens from above, otherwise they will try to double spend them (which won't work because the server keeps a list of all spent tokens):
```bash
cashu burn W3siYW1vdW50IjogMSwgIkMiOi...
```
Returns:
```bash
Balance: 420 sat (Available: 351 sat in 7 tokens)
Balance: 351 sat (Available: 351 sat in 7 tokens)
```
Use `cashu burn -a` to burn all used tokens or `cashu burn -f` to force a spent recheck on all tokens and burn them is they are used. This command is safe to use, it won't burn unspent tokens.

#### Check pending tokens
```bash
cashu pending
```
Returns
```bash
Amount: 64 sat Sent: 2022-09-28 06:53:03 ID: 33025ade-3efa-11ed-9096-16a10f0dbf61

Amount: 64 sat Sent: 2022-09-28 06:57:25 ID: cf588354-3efa-11ed-b5ec-16a10f0dbf61

Amount: 128 sat Sent: 2022-09-28 09:57:43 ID: fef371fa-3f13-11ed-b31a-16a10f0dbf61

W3siYW1vdW50Ij...

Balance: 1234 sat (Available: 1234 sat in 7 tokens)
```
You can either burn these tokens manually when the receiver has redeemed them, or you can receive them yourself if you want to cancel a pending payment.

# Running a mint
This command runs the mint on your local computer. Skip this step if you want to use the [public test mint](#test-instance) instead.
```bash
python -m cashu.mint
```

You can turn off Lightning support and mint as many tokens as you like by setting `LIGHTNING=FALSE` in the `.env` file.
