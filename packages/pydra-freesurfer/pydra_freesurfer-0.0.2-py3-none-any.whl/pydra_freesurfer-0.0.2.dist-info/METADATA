# pydra-freesurfer

Pydra tasks for FreeSurfer.

[Pydra] is a dataflow engine which provides a set of lightweight abstractions
for DAG construction, manipulation, and distributed execution.

[FreeSurfer] is a neuroimaging toolkit for processing, analyzing, and
visualizing human brain MR images.

This project exposes some of FreeSurfer's utilities as Pydra tasks to
facilitate their incorporation into more advanced processing workflows.
