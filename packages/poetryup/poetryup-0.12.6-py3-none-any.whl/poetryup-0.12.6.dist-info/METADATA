PoetryUp updates dependencies and bumps their version in both `poetry.lock` as
well as in `pyproject.toml` file. Dependencies version constraints are
respected, unless the `--latest` flag is passed, in which case dependencies will
be updated to their latest available version. PoetryUp runs
[poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) commands, thus it's required
to be installed. The difference between running `poetry update` and `poetryup`,
is that the latter also modifies the `pyproject.toml` file.
