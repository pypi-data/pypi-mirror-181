Description: # duro_rest
        
        An API client for the [Duro REST API](https://public-api.duro.app/v1/docs/).
        
        ## Installation

        ## Examples
        
        The Duro client is a very minimal API client for reading data from the [Duro v1 REST API](https://public-api.duro.app/v1/docs/). It does not define classes for each object type and instead returns plain dictionaries
        and lists.
        
        ```python
        from duro_rest import Client
        
        # Create a new client, providing your API key. By default clients will make calls to the public REST
        # API, but the endpoint base can be overridden if needed
        client = Client("your-api-key")
        
        # Fetch a component by its Duro assigned id (as opposed to the CPN)
        component = client.component("component-id")
        
        # Fetch a list of all components in Duro
        components = client.components()
        ```
