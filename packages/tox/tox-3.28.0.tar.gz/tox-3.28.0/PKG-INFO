# tox automation project

**Command line driven CI frontend and development task automation tool**

At its core tox provides a convenient way to run arbitrary commands in isolated environments to serve as a single entry
point for build, test and release activities.

tox is highly [configurable](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) and
[pluggable](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html).

## Example: run tests with Python 3.7 and Python 3.8

tox is mainly used as a command line tool and needs a `tox.ini` or a `tool.tox` section in `pyproject.toml` containing
the configuration.

To test a simple project that has some tests, here is an example with a `tox.ini` in the root of the project:

```ini
[tox]
envlist = py37,py38

[testenv]
deps = pytest
commands = pytest
```

```console
$ tox

[lots of output from what tox does]
[lots of output from commands that were run]

__________________ summary _________________
  py37: commands succeeded
  py38: commands succeeded
  congratulations :)
```

tox created two `testenvs` - one based on Python 3.7 and one based on Python 3.8, it installed pytest in them and ran
the tests. The report at the end summarizes which `testenvs` have failed and which have succeeded.

**Note:** To learn more about what you can do with tox, have a look at
[the collection of examples in the documentation](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) or
[existing projects using tox](https://github.com/search?l=INI&q=tox.ini+in%3Apath&type=Code).

### How it works

tox creates virtual environments for all configured so-called `testenvs`, it then installs the project and other
necessary dependencies and runs the configured set of commands. See
[system overview](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#system-overview) for more details.

- building and deploying project documentation
- releasing a package to PyPI or any other platform
- limit: your imagination
