# mkapi-fix-coz
A fork of [mkapi-fix](https://github.com/pwwang/mkapi) to fit our needs and gives publishing control. Without publishing controls we will get

> Public index servers SHOULD NOT allow the use of direct references in uploaded distributions. Direct references are intended as a tool for software integrators rather than publishers.
