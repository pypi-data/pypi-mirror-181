## FAQ



### 1) List of records

I have a doubt regarding the helpers doc, which function would you recommend to pull the list of Records the user has? E.g. I was thinking on Kadi_Metadata() but I would have to retrieve latter the keys from the .txt document. My other idea was to use Show_Kadi_Instances, but I'm not sure if that's what I'm looking for



**A:** Instance is the wording taken from the kadi-apy python module meaning the access to Kadi4Mat which consists of an host and a PAT. These instances are saved in the .kadi config file

Kadi_Metadata returns all information related to a record like title, author, creation time,... and extras which are the metadata of the process described in the record.

To show the record the user has you can simply use the Search_Items function with no args except instance and item: 

Search_Items(instance='YOUR_INSTANCE_NAME', item='record')



### 2) Kadi4Mat config file

How do I get the config file? Because I got a token from Kadi4mat, but I didn't get any document downloaded. Also, for the Search_Items, the instance will be again the config file with the user's data?



**A:** The creation of a config file is described here: https://kadi-apy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/setup/configuration.html

You use the commands in the command prompt.

kadi-apy create config      #creates config file

The other solution would be to just run the function Create_Kadi_Instance from my functions. It will create config file if it doesn't exist already.



The instance from the config file will be used for every function accessing Kadi4Mat.
