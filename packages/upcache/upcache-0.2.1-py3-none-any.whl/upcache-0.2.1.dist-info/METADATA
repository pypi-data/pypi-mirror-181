# Introduction

UpCache is a pure Python cache with multiprocessing support.

Most Python cache frameworks require external services such as Memcached or Redis which
require setup and maintenance.  UpCache tries to ameliorate the process of creating
a shared cache for multiprocessing workers such as those found in WSGI applications.

# Getting Started

Using UpCache requires at least one instance of UpCache to remain open and available for
contents to be preserved between worker processes.

Sample code provided will create a key-value pair in one process and allows another
process to access it:

```
from multiprocessing import Process
from upcache import UpCache
import time

def worker1(name: str) -> None:
    cache = UpCache(name)
    cache.set(b'Light Entertainment Awards', b'Dickie Attenborough')
    cache.close()

def worker2(name: str) -> None:
    cache = UpCache(name)
    time.sleep(1)
    print(cache.get(b'Light Entertainment Awards'))
    cache.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cache_name = 'TVHosts'
    p1 = Process(target=worker1, args=(cache_name,))
    p2 = Process(target=worker2, args=(cache_name,))

    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```
