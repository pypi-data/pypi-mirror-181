# OPA Python

Pythong client library for Open Policy Framework (OPA).

## Installation

opa-python is available on PyPi and can be installed with pip:

    pip install opa-python
    
Or Poetry if you prefer that:

    poetry add opa-python
    
## Compatibility

The library has been tested with:

- Python 3.10
- OPA 0.40.0
    
## Usage

Create a client instance:

    from opa import OPAClient
    client = OPAClient(url="http://opa-server/")
    
Create or update a document:

    data = {
        "users": [
            "bilbo",
            "frodo",
            "gandalf",
        ],
    }
    client.save_document("my.data", data)
    
Create or update a policy:

    policy = """
    package my.policy

    default allow := false

    allow {
        data.my.data.users[_] = input.name
    }
    """
    client.save_policy("policy-id", policy)
    
Check the policy:

    client.check_policy({"name": "bilbo"}, "my.policy.allow")

Or with another input value:

    client.check_policy({"name": "sauron"}, "my.policy.allow")

We're working on the documentation. Please refer to the tests or source code
in the meantime.
    
## Local installation

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), create new environment and
install the dependencies:

    poetry install
    
## Running the test suite

NOTE: Each individual test that communicates with OPA creates a fresh Docker
container. This is pretty neat from a testing perspective, but means that
running the entire suite takes a bit of time.

Make sure you do not have any services listening to `8181` when you start the
tests! We might add a configuration for setting the port later, or run the
tests in Docker as well.

Run the tests:

    poetry run pytest
    
Run specific test module:

    poetry run pytest tests/test_integration.py
    
## Publishing

Set your credentials:

    poetry config pypi-token.pypi <token>

Build and publish:

    poetry publish --build
