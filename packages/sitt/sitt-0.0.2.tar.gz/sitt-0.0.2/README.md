# Si.T.T. (Simulation of Traffic and Transport)

Si.T.T. is a program suite to simulate the traffic and transport of pre-industrial societies. It uses an agent-based
approach to model the simulation. An agent can be thought of as a batch of cargo transported through the network
(rather than an individual person travelling it).
