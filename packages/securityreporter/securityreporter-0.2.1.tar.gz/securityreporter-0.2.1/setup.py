The pentesters in turn are easily able to see which tasks are assigned, and they can access all required assessment details to get started.\n\nReporter supports granular access control distinctions, ensuring that every user only has access to that which they are required to have access to.\n\nWith Reporter clients may directly interact with researchers or other team members. After research findings are published, clients may ask questions regarding specific findings, or they may request retests.\n\nReporter has many functionalities, such as custom and built-in finding templates and automatic PDF generation, that will save you large amounts of time during your research.',
