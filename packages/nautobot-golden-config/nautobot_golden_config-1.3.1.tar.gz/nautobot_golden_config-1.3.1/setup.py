This is started by either a Nornir process for cli-like configurations or calling the API for json-like configurations\n5. **Configuration Postprocessing** - (beta) This process renders a valid configuration artifact from an intended configuration, that can be pushed to devices. The current implementation renders this configuration; however, **it doesn\'t push it** to the target device.\n\n> Notice: The operators of their own Nautobot instance are welcome to use any combination of these features. Though the appearance may seem like they are tightly coupled, this isn\'t actually the case. For example, one can obtain backup configurations from their current RANCID/Oxidized process and simply provide a Git Repo of the location of the backup configurations, and the compliance process would work the same way. Also, another user may only want to generate configurations, but not want to use other features, which is perfectly fine to do so.\n\n## Screenshots\n\nThere are many features and capabilities the plugin provides into the Nautobot ecosystem. The following screenshots are intended to provide a quick visual overview of some of these features.\n\nThe golden configuration is driven by jobs that run a series of tasks and the result is captured in this overview.\n\n![Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/develop/docs/images/ss_golden-overview.png)\n\nThe compliance report provides a high-level overview on the compliance of your network.\n![Compliance Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/develop/docs/images/ss_compliance-report.png)\n\nThe compliance overview will provide a per device and feature overview on the compliance of your network devices.\n![Compliance Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/develop/docs/images/ss_compliance-overview.png)\n\nDrilling into a specific device and feature, you can get an immediate detailed understanding of your device.\n![Compliance Device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/develop/docs/images/ss_compliance-device.png)\n\n![Compliance Rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/develop/docs/images/ss_compliance-rule.png)\n\n## Try it out!\n\nThis App is installed in the Nautobot Community Sandbox found over at [demo.nautobot.com](https://demo.nautobot.com/)!\n\n> For a full list of all the available always-on sandbox environments, head over to the main page on [networktocode.com](https://www.networktocode.com/nautobot/sandbox-environments/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull web-based HTML documentation for this app can be found over on the [Nautobot Docs](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/) website:\n\n- [User Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/user/app_overview/) - Overview, Using the App, Getting Started, Navigating compliance (cli, json, custom), backup, app usage, intended state creation.\n- [Administrator Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/admin/admin_install/) - How to Install, Configure, Upgrade, or Uninstall the App.\n- [Developer Guide](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/dev/dev_contributing/) - Extending the App, Code Reference, Contribution Guide.\n- [Release Notes / Changelog](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/admin/release_notes/)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/golden-config/en/latest/user/app_faq/)\n\n### Contributing to the Docs\n\nYou can find all the Markdown source for the App documentation under the [docs](https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot-plugin-golden-config/tree/develop/docs) folder in this repository.
