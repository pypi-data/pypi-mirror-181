## This environment serves the purpose of enabling deployment of QPID dispatch routers (aka QDR).
## Each overcloud node will have one local qdrouterd service running and forming a mesh topology,
## eg. QDRs running on controllers will operate in interior router mode, with connections to defined MetricsQdrConnectors
## and QDRs running on other node types will connect in edge mode to the interior routers running on the controllers.

    #  deployed anywhere and then behave accordingly (replace STF connection with connection into mesh).
