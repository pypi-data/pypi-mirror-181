deprecations:
  - enviornments/hyperconverged-ceph.yaml has been deprecated since Nov 2017 so it has been removed.
  - enviornments/storage-environment.yaml has been deprecated since Jan 2018 so it has been removed.
  - enviornments/storage-environment-external.yaml has been deprecated since Jan 2018 so it has been removed.
  - enviornments/tuned-ceph-filestore-hci.yaml is only for Filestore, though Bluestore has been the default for multiple Ceph releases, so it has been removed.
  - environments/updates/update-from-ceph-newton.yaml was only to be used when updating Ceph from the storage-environment template from Newton so Wallaby does not need to provide this file.
