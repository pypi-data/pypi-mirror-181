    Added FRR as a new TripleO service. This service allows cloud operators to
    deploy pure L3 control plane via BGP protocol. This has the following
    benefits:

    * Obtain multiple routes on multiple uplinks
    * BGP used for ECMP load balancing and BFD for resiliency
    * Advertise routes to API endpoints
    * Less L2 traffic

    Please refer to `Install and Configure FRRouter specification
    <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/tripleo-specs/specs/wallaby/triplo-bgp-frrouter.html>`_
    for more information.
