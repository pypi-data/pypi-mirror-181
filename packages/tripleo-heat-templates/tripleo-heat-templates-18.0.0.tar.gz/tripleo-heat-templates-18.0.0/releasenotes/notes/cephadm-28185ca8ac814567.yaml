features:
  - It is now possible to deploy Ceph with TripleO using cephadm.
deprecations:
  - Ceph Deployment using Ceph versions older than Octopus is deprecated.
  - |
    The CephOsdPercentageMin parameter has been deprecated and has a new default
    of 0 so that the validation is not run. There is no need to fail the deployment
    early if a percentage of the OSDs are not running because the Ceph pools created
    for OpenStack can now be created even if there are 0 OSDs as the PG number is no
    longer required on pool creation. TripleO no longer waits for OSD creation and
    instead only queues the request for OSD creation with the ceph orchestrator.
other:
  - |
    The CephPoolDefaultPgNum paramter default is now 16. The Ceph pg_autoscaler
    is enabled by default in the supported versions of Ceph though the parameter
    CephPoolDefaultPgNum may still be used as desired.
