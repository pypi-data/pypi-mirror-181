    The default value of the parameter 'RabbitAdditionalErlArgs' was
    updated to include the new options '+sbwtdcpu none +sbwtdio none'
    which disables busy-wait for dirty cpu schedulers and dirty i/o
    schedulers respectively.  This aligns with the flags recommended
    by RabbitMQ upstream
    (https://www.rabbitmq.com/runtime.html#busy-waiting).
