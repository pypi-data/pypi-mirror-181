deprecations:
  - |
    CephPoolDefaultPgNum and CephPoolDefaultSize have been deprecated and no
    longer affect the Ceph deployment because the Ceph deployment is run before
    these parameters are used. I.e. Ceph is deployed by TripleO via 'openstack
    overcloud ceph deploy' which does not use these parameters. It is no longer
    required to pass a PG number when creating Ceph pools but it is recommended
    to use CephPools to override target_size_ratio (or PG number) so pools do
    not inherit the default PG replica values depending on the Ceph release.
    Since Ceph pg_autoscale_mode is enabled by default in Pacific, PG numbers
    will adjust themselves correctly. However, data migration can be reduced by
    setting target_size_ratio (or PG number) in advance.
