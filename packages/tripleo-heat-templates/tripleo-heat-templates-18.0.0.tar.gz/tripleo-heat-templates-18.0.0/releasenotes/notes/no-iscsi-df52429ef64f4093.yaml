upgrade:
  - |
    The ``iscsi`` deploy interface is no longer enabled by default in ironic,
    making the ``direct`` deploy interface the default. You will need to
    update your nodes to the ``direct`` deploy before upgrading or re-enable
    the ``iscsi`` deploy in ``IronicEnabledDeployInterfaces`` (but note that
    it is going to be deprecated in the future).
  - |
    The ``IronicImageDownloadSource`` parameter has been changed to ``http`` by
    default making ironic cache glance images and serve them via a local HTTP
    server. Set the parameter to ``swift`` to return the previous behavior of
    relying on swift temporary URLs.
