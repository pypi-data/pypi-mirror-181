security:
  - |
    TripleO is now configuring the firewall using nftables instead of iptables.
  - |
    The firewall layout is now a bit different, since all of the TripleO managed rules are in
    dedicated chains, such as TRIPLEO_INPUT. Jumps are added in the original chains.
  - |
    The INPUT chain has now a "drop" policy, meaning we do not need the final "drop" rule
    like we had while using iptables. This means any packet that don't match a rule will be
    dropped. This also mean rule ordering is less important.
upgrade:
  - |
    All firewall rules are implemented by nftables instead of iptables. This means we don't
    need to edit anything anymore on the generated iptables/ip6tables files, and keep only the
    cleaning of service and files in the upgrade tasks.
other:
  - |
    iptables cli cannot see nftables content we inject, since we're
    using the "inet" family. Therefore, please use the "nft" CLI from
    now on. Doc has been updated accordingly.
