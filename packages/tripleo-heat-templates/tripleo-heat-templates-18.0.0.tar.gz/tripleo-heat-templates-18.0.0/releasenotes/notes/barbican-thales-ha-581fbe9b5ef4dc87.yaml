features:
  - The logic to configure the connection from barbican to nShield HSMs has
    been augmented to parse a nshield_hsms parameter, which allows the
    specification of multiple HSMs.  The underlying ansible role
    (ansible-role-thales-hsm) will configure the HSMs in load sharing mode
    to provide HA.
deprecations:
  - Some parameters within ThalesVars have been deprecated.  These are -
    thales_hsm_ip_address and thales_hsm_config_location.  See
    environments/barbican-backend-pkcs11-thales.yaml for details.
