upgrade:
  - |
    The following parameters (and the related deprecated parameters) have been
    removed since these have had no effect since Nova was removed from
    Undercloud.

    - ``KeyName``
    - ``Overcloud{{role.name}}Flavor``
    - ``{{role.name}}SchedulerHints``
    - {{role.name}}Image

  - |
    The configuration hook using cloud-init and node user data has been removed
    becuase this method is no longer available since Nova was removed from
    Undercloud. Because of this change, any reference to the following two
    resource types should be removed during upgrade.

    - ``OS::TripleO::NodeUserData``
    - ``OS::TripleO::{{role.name}}::NodeUserData``
