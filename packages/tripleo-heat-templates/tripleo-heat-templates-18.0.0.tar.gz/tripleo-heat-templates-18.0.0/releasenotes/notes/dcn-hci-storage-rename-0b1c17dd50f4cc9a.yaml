    dcn-hci.yaml has been renamed to dcn-storage.yaml because DCN sites with
    storage have the option of not using HCI (Hyper-Converged Infrastructure).
    dcn-hci.yaml is deprecated but will remain in the environments directory
    for backwards compatibility. dcn-hci.yaml will be removed during the X
    cycle. dcn-storage should be used in place of dcn-hci.yaml.
