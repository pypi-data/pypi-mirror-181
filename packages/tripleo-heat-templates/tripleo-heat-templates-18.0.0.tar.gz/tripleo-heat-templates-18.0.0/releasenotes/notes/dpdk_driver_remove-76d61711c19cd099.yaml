    ``OvsDpdkDriverType`` is now deprecated. Note that is had no effect since we
    upgraded to OVS 2.6, where we stopped supporting the configuration of DPDK driver
    in puppet-vswitch. Since then, we couldn't change the driver; so we can safely
    deprecate this parameter and remove it in a future release.
