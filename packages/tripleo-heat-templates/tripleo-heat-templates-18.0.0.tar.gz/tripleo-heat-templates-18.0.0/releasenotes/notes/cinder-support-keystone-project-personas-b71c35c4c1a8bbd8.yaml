    A new ``CinderPolicyEnforceNewDefaults`` parameter adds the ability to
    disable Cinder's deprecated authorization policies. The default value
    is False, which means Cinder's deprecated policies are enabled. Setting
    the parameter to True disables the deprecated policies, which causes
    Cinder to enforce the project-admin, project-member, and project-reader
    RBAC personas. Support for system personas is planned for a future release.
