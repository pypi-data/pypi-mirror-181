features:
  - |
    When the cinder-backup service is deployed, it now defaults to
    active-active and not active-passive.
upgrade:
  - |
    Cinder backup service will be switched from active-passive to active-active
    if the service was originally deployed using the cinder-backup.yaml
    environment file. Cloud administrators who wish to keep it active-passive
    should use the new cinder-backup-active-passive.yaml env file.
