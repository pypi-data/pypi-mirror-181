    It's not necessary to install ceph-ansible nor prepare a Ceph container
    when configuring external Ceph in Wallaby and newer.
    External ceph configuration is done with TripleO (not cephadm nor
    ceph-ansible) and should be executed using the related environment
    file.
features:
  - |
    The environment file environments/external-ceph.yaml has been created and
    can be used when an external Ceph cluster is used.
deprecations:
  - |
    The environment file environments/ceph-ansible/ceph-ansible-external.yaml
    has been deprecated and will be removed in X.
