    Fixes issues with PPC64le hardware utilization where documented steps require
    a ``/tftpboot/ppc64le`` folder to exist for artifacts to be placed as it is
    required path for the firmware loader in order to boot the kernel and
    ramdisk. The folder is now automatically created for the container.
