    to false, to be consistent with the default value in cinder.

upgrades:
  - |
    Since the default value of CinderNfsSnapshotSupport has been changed from
    true to false, the parameter should be explicitly set when enabling
    snapshot feature in cinder nfs snapshot support. Any users enabling the
    feature should be aware of the known issue which can cause data corruption.
    See `bug 1860913 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1860913>`_ to
