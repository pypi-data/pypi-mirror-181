    Decrease Swift proxy timeouts for GET/HEAD requests using a new parameter
    named SwiftProxyRecoverableNodeTimeout. The default node timeout is 10
    seconds in Swift, however this has been set to 60 seconds in TripleO in
    case there are slow nodes. However, this affects all requests - GET, HEAD
    and PUT. GET/HEAD requests are typically much faster, thus it makes sense
    to use a lower timeout to recover earlier from node failures.  This will
    increase stability, because the proxy can select another backend node to
    retry the request.
