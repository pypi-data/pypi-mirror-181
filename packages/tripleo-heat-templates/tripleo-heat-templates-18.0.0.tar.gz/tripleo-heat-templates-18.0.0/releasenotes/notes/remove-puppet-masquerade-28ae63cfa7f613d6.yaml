    Removes the "masquerade-networks-baremetal-puppet" deployment file,
    since it has been replaced by a 100% ansible implementation; this
    removal won't affect operators, since the inclusion of the actual
    services/masquerade-networks is done from within the Undercloud
    deployment only, when we set the "masquerade" parameter to true
    for selected networks.
