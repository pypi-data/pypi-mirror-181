    Keystone can now be configured to support secure RBAC `personas
    <https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/admin/service-api-protection.html#roles-definitions>`_
    with the `EnforceSecureRbac` setting. Note that deployments with mixed permission
    models will have unexpected side-effects. Setting this option won't have
    meaningful effect until all services in your deployment support secure RBAC
    personas.
