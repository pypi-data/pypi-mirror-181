    Adds NovaRestrictLiveMigration boolean parmeter to enable an
    api policy to allow live migration only for a specific role
    which can be customized using NovaRestrictLiveMigrationRole.
    This feature is to prevent the default admin role users to
    be able to use live migration on coincidence.
    Additional policies specified using NovaApiPolicies get
    merged with this policy.
