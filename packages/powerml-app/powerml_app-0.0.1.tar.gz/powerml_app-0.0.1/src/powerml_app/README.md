Python package

# Start of tests that can be used for a python module!
* run_ai.py: Runs the AI model (calls external/gpt3.py which is just our ai_apis)
* utils.py: Most of the code lives here for postprocessing

Different model-based functions:
* fuzzy_assert_equals
* fuzzy_coherence_check
* fuzzy_contains
* fuzzy_duplicate_filter
