    """Counts contact observed by :func:`monkeybread.calc.cell_contact`.

    Sums the number of unique contacts given the contact dictionary and ids corresponding to
    cells in each group. Can be used to extract more specific contact counts out of a larger
    dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    contacts
        A dictionary mapping from cell indices to other cell indices, as returned by
        :func:`monkeybread.calc.cell_contact`.
    group1
        Cell indices corresponding to `group1`.
    group2
        Cell indices corresponding to `group2`.

    Returns
    -------
    The number of unique contacts found between `group1` and `group2`.
