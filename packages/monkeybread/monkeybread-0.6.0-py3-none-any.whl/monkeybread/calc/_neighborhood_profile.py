    """Calculates a neighborhood profile for each cell.

    The resulting AnnData object will have the same index corresponding to rows/cells, but a new
    index corresponding to columns, one column for each category in `adata.obs[groupby]`. Instead of
    a gene expression profile, each column corresponds to the proportion of cells in the surrounding
    radius that belong to the respective category.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Annotated data matrix.
    groupby
        A categorical column in `obs` to use for neighborhood profile calculations.
    basis
        Coordinates in `adata.obsm[X_{basis}]` to use. Defaults to `spatial`.
    subset_output_features
        A list of groups from `adata.obs[groupby]` to include in the resulting `adata.var_names`.
        Will not affect the calculations themselves, only which results are provided.
    subset_cells_by_group
        A list of groups in `adata.obs[groupby]` to restrict the resulting AnnData object to. Only
        cells in those groups will be included in the resulting `adata.obs_names`.
    radius
        Radius in coordinate space to include nearby cells for neighborhood profile calculation.
    n_neighbors
        Number of neighbors to consider for the neighborhood profile calculations.
    normalize_counts
        Normalize neighborhood counts to proportions instead of raw counts. Note, if
        `subset_output_features` is provided and `normalize_counts = True`, the normalization step will
        be performed before removing groups, so proportions will not sum to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    A new AnnData object where columns now correspond to neighborhood profile proportions. All .obs
    columns will be carried over from the provided AnnData object, and they will share an index.
