Description: # Redshfiting
        
        Use this package to shift radio sources (AGN, Clusters, ...) from a given redshift to a higher redshift. \
        This can all be done in image plane, by giving a fits image as input.
        
        Example to move the Perseus cluster from redshift 0.018 to 1.318:
        
        ```
        from redshifting import move_source
        myfits = 'Perseus_HBA_full.fits'
        move_source(input_fits=myfits, orig_z=0.018, dz=1.3, output_fits='shifted_'+myfits)
        ```
        
        This package is also on pypi:
