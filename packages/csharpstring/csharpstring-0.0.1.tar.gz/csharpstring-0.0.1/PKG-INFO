# CSharpString
A general class that provides dot-net style syntax for python string manipulations.


## Static & Instance Namespaces
To more easily seperate the objective, from non-objective functionality there are two
classes internally that can be used. 
1. csharpstring.instance
2. csharpstring.static

## Instance Methods
`
value1 = instance("The quick brown fox");
print(value1)
> The quick brown fox
value2 = instance("jumped over the lazy dog");
print(value2)
> jumped over the lazy dog
value3 = value1.Append(value2);
print(value3)
>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
value4 = value3.Substr(10,30);
>brown fox jumped ove
value5 = value3.Replace("quick", "speedy");
print(value5)
>The speedy brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
`

## Static Methods
`
date = "10/31/22";
time = "8:30 PM";
print(static.Format("It is $0 on $1; do you know where your children are?", time, date));
print(static.Join(" ", value1, value2));
>It is 8:30 PM on 10/31/22; do you know where your children are?
>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
