    "## Setting up a virtual screen\n",
    "\n",
    "The object model of `pyscreener` is centered around the `VirtualScreen` object. Abstractly, this object represents a **unfiorm** screening protocol against which 10s to millions of compounds will be screened. Roughly, a virtual screening protocol includes the following information:\n",
    "1. the target\n",
    "2. the docking box\n",
    "3. the screening parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The last of these is the most abstract, as we use this to lump all program-specific arguments together. For example, AutoDock Vina type programs might support only a few arguments like `--exhaustiveness` to control the exhaustiveness of the search process, but DOCK6 includes a variety of parameters to fine tune the search process, like `simplex_tors_step`. Obviously, both programs use some knowledge of the target (1) and the docking box (2), but beyond that, they don't have much in common in terms of how they're run.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wealth of possble options for how a virtual screen *might* be conducted, but our primary goal with `pyscreener` is to support users who really want to rely on the base docking parameters to quickly filter out possible compound ideas with the *ability* to support as much customization as the raw docking programs allow. With an eye towards servicing that first group of users, our goal is to minimize the overhead needed to setup a virtual screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell shows an example of setting up a screening protocol against the D4 dopamine receptor 5WIU using AutoDock Vina using the docking box centered at the given coordinates with the specified x-, y-, and z-radii. Because AutoDock Vina can leverage multiple cores during a docking run, we additionally specify that each process will be allotted `6` cores."
