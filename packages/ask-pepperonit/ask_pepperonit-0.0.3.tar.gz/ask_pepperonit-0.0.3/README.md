# Web_Interaction_Package (ask_pepperonit)

This is a small part collection of methods from a Pepper project. This package does not have any value by itself, but is rather customized for our colleagues to call upon certain methods within their block-programming module.

Functionality mainly revolves around doing calls to Google's and Wikipedia's API with text(string) input and having Pepper display the results in an appropriate way.
