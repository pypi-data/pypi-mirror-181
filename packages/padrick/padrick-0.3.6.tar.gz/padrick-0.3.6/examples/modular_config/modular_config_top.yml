# This padframe config showcases how to write modular padframe config files for
# easier reuse across different technologies or simulation/emulation targets.
# The basis of it is the usage of the custom YAML directive !include <fle to
# yaml, toml, ini, csv or txt file>. The directive also supports wildcard
# inclusion of multiple files. Checkout the documentation of pyyaml-inlcude for
# the complete syntax "https://pypi.org/project/pyyaml-include/".

# This particular example defines the padframe for Xilinx Virtex 7 FPGAs. For an
# ASIC version, you could write new my_asic_tech_padtypes.yml and
# my_asic_tech_pads.yml files, create a copy of this file and change the include
# paths.
