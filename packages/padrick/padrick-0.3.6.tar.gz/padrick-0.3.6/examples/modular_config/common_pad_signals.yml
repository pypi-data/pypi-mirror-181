# This file defines the common pad signal names used in this project. The reason
# we want to define these in a common place is, that if we stick to the same
# signal names regardless the target platform/technology, we can leave the
# port_groups specification untouched while only changing the pad_types. This
# means that we should add all the pad signals to this file that might be used
# in a peripheral connection in the port_groups section. Signals like 'driving
# strenght' are probably not necessary to add here and are anyway highly
# technology dependend in their semantic.
