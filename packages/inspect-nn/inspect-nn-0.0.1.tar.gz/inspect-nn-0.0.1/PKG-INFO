Description: # inspect-nn : simPle sImulator for Neural nEtworks using APProximate muLtipliErs (written in python)
        
        inspect-nn is a simulation tool for measuring the classification accuracy loss due to the use of approximate multipliers (i.e., multipliers designed by exploiting the [approximate computing design paradigm](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-94705-7)) in neural networks. 
        
        It has been developed to easily do porting of keras/tensorflow models, and to use the GPU to simulate a neural network while using approximate arithmetic units quickly and almost effortlessly. 
        
        Anyway, it is still under development!
