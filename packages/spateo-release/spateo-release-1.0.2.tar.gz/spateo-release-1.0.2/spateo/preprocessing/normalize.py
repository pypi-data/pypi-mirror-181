    Normalize counts per cell.
    Normalize each cell by total counts over all genes, so that every cell has the same total count after normalization.

    If `exclude_highly_expressed=True`, very highly expressed genes are excluded from the computation of the
    normalization factor (size factor) for each cell. This is meaningful as these can strongly influence the resulting
    normalized values for all other genes.

    Args:
        adata: The annotated data matrix of shape `n_obs` Ã— `n_vars`. Rows correspond to cells and columns to genes.
        target_sum: Desired sum of counts for each gene post-normalization. If `None`, after normalization,
            each observation (cell) will have a total count equal to the median of total counts for observations (
            cells) before normalization.
        exclude_highly_expressed: Exclude (very) highly expressed genes for the computation of the normalization factor
            for each cell. A gene is considered highly expressed if it has more than `max_fraction` of the total counts
            in at least one cell.
        max_fraction: If `exclude_highly_expressed=True`, this is the cutoff threshold for excluding genes.
        key_added: Name of the field in `adata.obs` where the normalization factor is stored.
        layer: Layer to normalize instead of `X`. If `None`, `X` is normalized.
        inplace: Whether to update `adata` or return dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers`.
        copy: Whether to modify copied input object. Not compatible with inplace=False.

    Returns:
        Returns dictionary with normalized copies of `adata.X` and `adata.layers` or updates `adata` with normalized
        version of the original `adata.X` and `adata.layers`, depending on `inplace`.
