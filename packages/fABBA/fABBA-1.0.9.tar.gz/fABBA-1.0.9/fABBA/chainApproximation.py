    Parameters
    ----------

        The tolerance that controls the accuracy.

    Reconstruct time series from its first value `ts0` and its `pieces`.
    `pieces` must have (at least) two columns, incremenent and window width, resp.
    A window width w means that the piece ranges from s to s+w.
    In particular, a window width of 1 is allowed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start - float
        First element of original time series. Applies vertical shift in
        reconstruction.

    pieces - numpy array
